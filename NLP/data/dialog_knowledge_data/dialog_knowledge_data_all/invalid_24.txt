Percussion may be dulled over the affected lung, and increased, rather than decreased, vocal resonance distinguishes pneumonia from a pleural effusion.

These symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and a stuffy or runny nose. Coughing is the most common symptom. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis, especially in children. The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 - 8 days.

In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old. More severe signs and symptoms in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness. Bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually result in similar symptoms. Some causes are associated with classic, but non-specific, clinical characteristics. Pneumonia caused by Legionella may occur with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or confusion Pneumonia Pneumonia",
  "response": "Various actions are taken, such as vaccination campaigns, promoting good hygiene practices, improving indoor air quality, and raising awareness about pneumonia prevention."

      "Hi Medi, I've heard that pneumonia rates in infants can be reduced. How?",

Zinc supplementation in children 2 months to five years old appears to reduce rates of pneumonia. For people with low levels of vitamin C in their diet or blood, taking vitamin C supplements may be suggested to decrease the risk of pneumonia, although there is no strong evidence of benefit. There is insufficient evidence to recommend that the general population take vitamin C to prevent or treat pneumonia. For adults and children in the hospital who require a respirator, there is no strong evidence indicating a difference between heat and moisture exchangers and heated humidifiers for preventing pneumonia Pneumonia Pneumonia",
    "response": "Pneumonia can be prevented in infants by testing pregnant women for Group B Streptococcus and Chlamydia trachomatis, and administering antibiotic treatment if needed. Preventive measures for HIV transmission from mother to child may also help reduce rates of pneumonia in infants."
