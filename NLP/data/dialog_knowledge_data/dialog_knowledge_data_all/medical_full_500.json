The use of antihypertensive medication for children with hypertension has limited evidence. There is limited evidence comparing antihypertensive medication with placebo, but it shows modest short-term effects on blood pressure. Higher doses of medication do not necessarily lead to greater reduction in blood pressure. Resistant hypertension refers to high blood pressure that remains above target levels despite being prescribed three or more antihypertensive drugs with different mechanisms of action. Noncompliance with prescribed medications is a common cause of resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension can also be caused by chronically high activity of the autonomic nervous system, known as neurogenic hypertension.",
