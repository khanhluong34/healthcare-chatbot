Other causes include long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol abuse, and autoimmune disorders. The symptoms of gastritis can include abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of fullness in the upper abdomen. Treatment for gastritis depends on the underlying cause and may include antibiotics, acid-reducing medications, and lifestyle changes. Gastritis can usually be cured with appropriate treatment, but it can lead to complications if left untreated.",
