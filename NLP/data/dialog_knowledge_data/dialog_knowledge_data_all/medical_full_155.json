        "knowledge": "Cancer Cancer The Preventive Services Task Force issues recommendations for various cancers.  Screens for gastric cancer using photofluorography are recommended due to the high incidence there.  Genetic testing for individuals at high-risk of certain cancers is recommended by unofficial groups.  Carriers of these mutations may then undergo enhanced surveillance, chemoprevention, or preventative surgery to reduce their subsequent risk.  Many treatment options for cancer exist.  The primary ones include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy and palliative care.  Which treatments are used depends on the type, location and grade of the cancer as well as the patient's health and preferences.",
