The paranasal sinuses are connected to the nasal cavity by small orifices called ostia.  The sinuses are compartments filled with air that develop from the nasal cavity and have the same lining as the nasal cavity.  Therefore, they are subject to the same conditions that can affect the nose, such as infection or inflammation. As a group, they contribute to the reduction of skull weight, assist with voice resonance, and function as thermal and humidity buffers. Sinusitis Sinusitis",
