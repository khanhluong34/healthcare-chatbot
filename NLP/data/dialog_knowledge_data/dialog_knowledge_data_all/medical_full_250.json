While many mothers are able to breastfeed successfully, concerns about breastfeeding include the time commitment, the possibility of discomfort or pain, and difficulty in returning to work.   The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, with solids gradually being introduced around this age when signs of readiness are shown.  Breastfeeding should continue with the addition of other foods through the age of at least two years.",
