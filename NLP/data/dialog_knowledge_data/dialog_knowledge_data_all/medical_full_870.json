Among antipsychotic drugs for treating schizophrenia clozapine is the most effective, but it also has the highest risk of causing the metabolic syndrome, of which obesity is the main feature.  For people who gain weight because of clozapine, taking metformin may reportedly improve three of the five components of the metabolic syndrome: waist circumference, fasting glucose, and fasting triglycerides. The most effective treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery.  The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion.  Surgery for severe obesity is associated with long-term weight loss, improvement in obesity-related conditions, and decreased overall mortality; however, improved metabolic health results from the weight loss, not the surgery.  One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25%  at 10 years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures Obesity Obesity",

As such, managing it requires changes in the wider societal context and effort by communities, local authorities, and governments.  Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population.  Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity.  Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools.  The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks.
