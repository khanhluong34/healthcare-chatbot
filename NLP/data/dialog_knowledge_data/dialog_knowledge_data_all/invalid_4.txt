    "knowledge": "Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease   There is moderate quality evidence that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.  High trans-fat intake has adverse effects on blood lipids and circulating inflammatory markers, and elimination of trans-fat from diets has been widely advocated.  In 2018 the World Health Organization estimated that trans fats were the cause of more than half a million deaths per year.  There is evidence that higher consumption of sugar is associated with higher blood pressure and unfavorable blood lipids, and sugar intake also increases the risk of diabetes mellitus.  High consumption of processed meats is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, possibly in part due to increased dietary salt intake. The relationship between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease is complex, and may depend on the amount of alcohol consumed.  There is a direct relationship between high levels of drinking alcohol and cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease",

    "knowledge": "Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  Working  with  the  electrolytic production of  aluminium  or  the  production  of  paper  when  the  sulphate pulping  process  is  used  is  associated with heart disease.  An association was also found  between  heart  disease  and  exposure  to  compounds  which  are  no  longer  permitted  in certain  work  environments,  such  as  phenoxy acids containing TCDD or asbestos. Workplace exposure to silica dust or asbestos is also associated with pulmonary heart disease.

Possible explanations may include cold temperature-induced changes in the respiratory system, decreased immune response, and low humidity causing an increase in viral transmission rates, perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer. The apparent seasonality may also be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school.  Although normal exposure to cold does not increase one's risk of infection, severe exposure leading to significant reduction of body temperature  may put one at a greater risk for the common cold; although controversial, the majority of evidence suggests that it may increase susceptibility to infection. Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections.  Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease.

"knowledge": "Diabetes Diabetes  The disease was considered rare during the time of the Roman empire, with Galen commenting he had only seen two cases during his career.  This is possibly due to the diet and lifestyle of the ancients, or because the clinical symptoms were observed during the advanced stage of the disease.  Galen named the disease "diarrhea of the urine" . The earliest surviving work with a detailed reference to diabetes is that of Aretaeus of Cappadocia .  He described the symptoms and the course of the disease, which he attributed to the moisture and coldness, reflecting the beliefs of the "Pneumatic School".  He hypothesized a correlation between diabetes and other diseases, and he discussed differential diagnosis from the snakebite, which also provokes excessive thirst.  His work remained unknown in the West until 1552, when the first Latin edition was published in Venice Diabetes Diabetes",

Evidence does not support a role for specific foods, including spicy foods and coffee, in the development of peptic ulcers.  People are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them.  There is little specific advice on diet published by authoritative sources.  The website of the National Health Service of the United Kingdom advises "avoiding foods that can irritate the stomach, such as spicy, acidic or fried foods", and suggests that "you may want to talk to a GP about this". Acute erosive gastritis typically involves discrete foci of surface necrosis due to damage to mucosal defenses.

Over time, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which additionally involves liver cell death, liver inflammation and possible fibrosis.  Factors accelerating progression from NAFLD to NASH are obesity, older age, non-African American ethnicity, female gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, higher ALT or AST level, higher AST/ALT ratio, low platelet count, and an ultrasound steatosis score. In the early stages , most patients are asymptomatic or have mild right upper quadrant pain, and diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests.

In alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, a co-dominant mutation in the gene for alpha-1-antitrypsin results in the abnormal accumulation of the mutant AAT protein within liver cells, leading to liver disease. Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are both autosomal recessive diseases involving abnormal storage of minerals. In hemochromatosis, excess amounts of iron accumulate in multiple body sites, including the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis. In Wilson's disease, excess amounts of copper accumulate in the liver and brain, causing cirrhosis and dementia. When the liver is involved, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and Wilson's disease tend to present as hepatitis in the neonatal period or in childhood.

Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes , evidence of cellular injury and cell death , evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies. Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.  In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.  For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.  In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.  Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis Hepatitis Hepatitis",

In the Mediterranean, hepatitis D is predominant among hepatitis B virus co-infected people. Similar to Hepatitis A, hepatitis E manifests as large outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water sources. It accounts for more than 55,000 deaths annually with approximately 20 million people worldwide thought to be infected with the virus. It affects predominantly young adults, causing acute hepatitis. In infected pregnant women, Hepatitis E infection can lead to fulminant hepatitis with third trimester mortality rates as high as 30%.
