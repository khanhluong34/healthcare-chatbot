            "Of course! I'm here to provide guidance. After a medical procedure, it's important to take care of your lifestyle, diet, and engage in appropriate physical exercise.",
            "What kind of lifestyle changes should I make?",
            "You should prioritize rest and allow your body time to heal. It's also essential to avoid smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke, as it can further damage the lungs.",
            "How about my diet? Are there any specific recommendations?",
            "A balanced diet rich in nutrients, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, can support your recovery. Staying hydrated is also important.",
            "And what about physical exercise?",
            "Engaging in light physical activities as recommended by your healthcare provider can help improve your lung function. It's important to gradually increase activity levels as you recover.",

        "knowledge": "Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray. In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely. However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial causes of pneumonia.",
        "response": "The recovery time after a lung-related medical procedure can vary depending on the specific procedure performed and individual factors. It's best to consult with your healthcare provider for an accurate estimate."
