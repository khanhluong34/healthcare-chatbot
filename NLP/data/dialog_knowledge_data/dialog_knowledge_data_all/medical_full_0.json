A resting heart rate that is too fast \u2013 above 100 beats per minute in adults \u2013 is called tachycardia, and a resting heart rate that is too slow \u2013 below 60 beats per minute \u2013 is called bradycardia.  Some types of arrhythmias have no symptoms.  Symptoms, when present, may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats.  In more serious cases, there may be lightheadedness, passing out, shortness of breath or chest pain.  While most cases of arrhythmia are not serious, some predispose a person to complications such as stroke or heart failure.  Others may result in sudden death Arrhythmia Arrhythmia",
