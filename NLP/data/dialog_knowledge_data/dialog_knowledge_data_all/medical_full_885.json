            "Hi Medi, I have some concerns about obesity.",
            "Of course, I'm here to help. What specifically would you like to know?",
            "I've heard that NFL players can be classified as obese based on BMI, but their body fat percentage is within a healthy range. How does that work?",
            "That's correct. BMI is just one measurement, and it doesn't take into account factors like muscle mass. Some athletes, like NFL players, have a higher BMI due to their muscle mass, but their body fat percentage is still healthy.",
            "Interesting. So, does obesity increase the risk of any specific diseases?",
            "Yes, obesity is linked to various metabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and certain types of cancer.",
            "That's concerning. Does obesity also affect life expectancy?",
            "Yes, depending on the degree of obesity and the presence of other health conditions, obesity can be associated with a shorter life expectancy of 2-20 years.",
            "I see. Is there anything I can do to reduce my risk of obesity-related diseases?"

        "knowledge": "Obesity Obesity  For example, more than half of all NFL players are classified as 'obese,' and 1 in 4 are classified as 'extremely obese,' according to the BMI metric. However, their mean body fat percentage, 14%, is well within what is considered a healthy range. Similarly, Sumo wrestlers may be categorized by BMI as 'severely obese' or 'very severely obese,' but many Sumo wrestlers are not categorized as obese when body fat percentage is used instead. Some Sumo wrestlers were found to have no more body fat than a non-Sumo comparison group, with high BMI values resulting from their high amounts of lean body mass. Obesity increases a person's risk of developing various metabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and certain types of cancer. Depending on the degree of obesity and the presence of comorbid disorders, obesity is associated with an estimated 2-20 year shorter life expectancy. High BMI is a marker of risk for, but not a direct cause of, diseases caused by diet and physical activity Obesity Obesity",

As such, managing it requires changes in the wider societal context and effort by communities, local authorities, and governments. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks.
