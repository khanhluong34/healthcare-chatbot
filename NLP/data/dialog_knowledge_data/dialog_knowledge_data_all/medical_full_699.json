The brain is not sensitive to pain because it lacks pain receptors.  Rather, the pain is caused by disturbance of the pain-sensitive structures around the brain.  Headaches can be primary (caused by disorders of or related to structures in the head) or secondary (a symptom of an underlying disease or other problem that stimulates the pain-sensitive nerves of the head).  The most common types of primary headache are tension headache, migraine, and cluster headache. Headaches can be caused by a variety of factors such as dehydration, stress, sinus infection, or lack of sleep. Headache Headache",
