These symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and a stuffy or runny nose. Coughing is the most common symptom. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis, especially in children. The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 - 8 days. A 2021 study suggests influenza can cause long lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID. Symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract, but progression to pneumonia is relatively common Influenza Influenza",
