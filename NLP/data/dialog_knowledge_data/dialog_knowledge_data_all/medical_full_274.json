This results in the body's inability to produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is not known, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment involves insulin therapy, carbohydrate counting, and continuous glucose monitoring. Complications of type 1 diabetes include heart disease, nerve damage, kidney damage, eye damage, and foot damage.",
