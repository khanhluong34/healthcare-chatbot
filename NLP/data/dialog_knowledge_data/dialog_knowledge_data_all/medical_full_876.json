            "I'm curious about how obesity was viewed in the past. Can you shed some light on that?",
            "Certainly. Historically, obesity was often associated with wealth and prosperity. It was common among high officials in Europe, as well as in Ancient East Asian civilizations.",
            "That's fascinating. Was there any change in perception over time?",
            "Yes, during the Industrial Revolution, it was realized that the size and strength of soldiers and workers played a significant role in the military and economic might of nations. This led to an increase in average body mass index and a shift towards obesity in industrialized societies.",
            "I see. So, obesity's prevalence increased during that period?",
            "Exactly. As populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing more than height, resulting in the rise of obesity during the 20th century.",
            "Wow, it's interesting how perceptions and circumstances influenced obesity. Thanks for the explanation!"

        "knowledge": "Obesity Obesity Obesity has thus historically been viewed as a sign of wealth and prosperity. It was common among high officials in Europe in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance as well as in Ancient East Asian civilizations. In the 17th century, English medical author Tobias Venner is credited with being one of the first to refer to the term as a societal disease in a published English language book. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, it was realized that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers. Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range played a significant role in the development of industrialized societies. Height and weight thus both increased through the 19th century in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity Obesity Obesity",
        "response": "In the past, obesity was often seen as a symbol of wealth and prosperity. It was prevalent among high officials in Europe and Ancient East Asian civilizations. However, with the rise of industrialized societies, the focus shifted to the importance of body size and strength for military and economic power. This led to an increase in average body mass index and the subsequent rise of obesity during the 20th century."

As such, managing it requires changes in the wider societal context and effort by communities, local authorities, and governments. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity.
