In Book IV of the Canon, Ibn Sina discussed epidemics, outlining the classical miasma theory and attempting to blend it with his own early contagion theory. He mentioned that people can transmit disease to others by breath, noted contagion with tuberculosis, and discussed the transmission of disease through water and dirt. The concept of invisible contagion was later discussed by several Islamic scholars in the Ayyubid Sultanate who referred to them as najasat. The fiqh scholar Ibn al-Haj al-Abdari, while discussing Islamic diet and hygiene, gave warnings about how contagion can contaminate water, food, and garments, and could spread through the water supply, and may have implied contagion to be unseen particles. When the Black Death bubonic plague reached Al-Andalus in the 14th century, the Arab physicians Ibn Khatima and Ibn al-Khatib hypothesized that infectious diseases were caused by \"minute bodies\" and described how they can be transmitted through garments, vessels and earrings.
