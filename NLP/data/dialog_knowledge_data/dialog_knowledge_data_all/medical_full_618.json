These symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and a stuffy or runny nose. Coughing is the most common symptom. The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 - 8 days. A 2021 study suggests influenza can cause long lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID.

Placing poultry houses and piggeries on high ground away from high-density farms, backyard farms, live poultry markets, and bodies of water also helps to minimize contact with wild birds. Closure of live poultry markets appears to the most effective measure and has shown to be effective at controlling the spread of H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. Other biosecurity measures include cleaning and disinfecting facilities and vehicles, banning visits to poultry farms, not bringing birds intended for slaughter back to farms, changing clothes, disinfecting foot baths, and treating food and water.",
