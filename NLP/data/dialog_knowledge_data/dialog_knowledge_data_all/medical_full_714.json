        "knowledge": "Meningitis Meningitis  Other clues on the cause of meningitis may be the skin signs of hand, foot and mouth disease and genital herpes, both of which are associated with various forms of viral meningitis. Additional problems may occur in the early stage of the illness.  These may require specific treatment, and sometimes indicate severe illness or worse prognosis.  The infection may trigger sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome of falling blood pressure, fast heart rate, high or abnormally low temperature, and rapid breathing.  Very low blood pressure may occur at an early stage, especially but not exclusively in meningococcal meningitis; this may lead to insufficient blood supply to other organs.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation, the excessive activation of blood clotting, may obstruct blood flow to organs and paradoxically increase the bleeding risk.  Gangrene of limbs can occur in meningococcal disease Meningitis Meningitis",
        "response": "There are vaccines available for certain types of meningitis. It's recommended to stay up to date with vaccinations and practice good hygiene to reduce the risk of infection."
