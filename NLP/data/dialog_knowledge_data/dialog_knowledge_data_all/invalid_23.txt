           "I see. Are there any specific precautions I should take if I'm obese?",
           "It's important to follow preventive measures like wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, and maintaining social distancing. Additionally, it's a good idea to focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle.",

"knowledge": "Obesity Obesity On average, obesity reduces life expectancy by six to seven years, a BMI of 30–35 kg/m2 reduces life expectancy by two to four years, while severe obesity reduces life expectancy by ten years. Obesity increases the risk of many physical and mental conditions. These comorbidities are most commonly shown in metabolic syndrome, a combination of medical disorders which includes: diabetes mellitus type 2, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and high triglyceride levels. A study from the RAK Hospital found that obese people are at a greater risk of developing long COVID. The CDC has found that obesity is the single strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle.
