    "Hi, Medi. I've been reading about mental illness and its diagnosis.",
    "I'm here to help. What would you like to know about it?",
    "I'm curious about how mental illness is diagnosed without objective biological tests.",
    "That's true. Currently, mental illness diagnosis relies on subjective judgments rather than objective tests.",
    "Hmm, that seems concerning. What about overdiagnosis? Is that a problem too?",
    "Yes, overdiagnosis can be unpredictable and raise concerns. It's been a topic of discussion among psychiatrists and critics.",
    "I see. Some critics claim that psychiatry medicalizes normality. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "There have been accusations of psychiatry engaging in the medicalization of normality. It's a controversial subject.",
    "I see. Is there any concern about expanding the boundaries of illness definitions?",
    "Absolutely. There are concerns about expanding the definition of illnesses to include personal problems or emphasizing disease risks to broaden the market for medications.",
    "That's quite concerning. Thank you for the information, Medi. Can you tell me more about the topic?"
  ],
  "knowledge": "Mental illness still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests. Frances was also concerned about unpredictable overdiagnosis. For many years, marginalized psychiatrists and outside critics have been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality. More recently, these concerns have come from insiders who have worked for and promoted the American Psychiatric Association. A 2002 editorial in the British Medical Journal warned of inappropriate medicalization leading to disease mongering, where the boundaries of the definition of illnesses are expanded to include personal problems as medical problems or risks of diseases are emphasized to broaden the market for medications. Gary Greenberg, a psychoanalyst, in his book 'the Book of Woe,' argues that mental illness is really about suffering and how the DSM creates diagnostic labels to categorize people's suffering.",
  "response": "Certainly! Mental illness diagnosis is a complex topic. It relies on subjective judgments and has been a subject of debate and criticism. Would you like more specific information about any aspect?"

    "I understand. Those are common symptoms associated with mental illness. How long have you been experiencing them?",
    "It's been going on for a few weeks now. I can't seem to shake these feelings.",
    "Have there been any recent changes or events that could have triggered these symptoms?",
    "Not that I can think of. Things have been relatively normal in my life.",
    "I see. Sometimes, symptoms can appear without an apparent cause. It's important to address them. ",
    "Thank you, Medi. Can you provide some insight into what might be wrong with me?",
    "Based on your symptoms of anxiety, sleep problems, and loss of interest, it's possible that you're experiencing a form of mental illness. However, a proper diagnosis would require a consultation with a healthcare professional.",
    "I see. I'll consider seeking professional help. Thank you for your assistance."

    "Thank you for the advice, Medi. I want to know more about the potential risks or complications after the procedure.",
    "Every medical procedure carries some risks and potential complications. It's best to discuss them with your doctor, as they can provide personalized information based on your case.",
    "I'll make sure to consult my doctor about it. Thanks for your guidance, Medi!"

DSM-IV predicates the definition with caveats, stating that, as in the case with many medical terms, mental disorder 'lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations,' noting that different levels of abstraction can be used for medical definitions, including pathology, symptomology, deviance from a normal range, or etiology, and that the same is true for mental disorders so that sometimes one type of definition is appropriate, and sometimes another, depending on the situation.
