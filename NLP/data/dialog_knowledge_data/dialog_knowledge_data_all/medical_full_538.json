It is the most common infectious disease in humans.  Symptoms include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, and fever which usually resolve in 7-10 days, with some symptoms lasting up to three weeks.  In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35-40% of cases.  Symptoms are largely due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves.  There is no cure for the common cold, but the symptoms can be treated.  Hand washing and wearing masks can prevent its spread. Common cold Common cold",
