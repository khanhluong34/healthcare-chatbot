            "What is insulin resistance, and what causes it?",
            "Insulin resistance is when cells in your body don't respond well to insulin, which is a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels. The exact cause of insulin resistance is still not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors.",
            "Can insulin resistance lead to diabetes?",
            "Yes, insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes if left untreated. That's because the pancreas has to produce more insulin to help cells absorb glucose. Over time, the pancreas may not be able to keep up, leading to high blood sugar levels and type 2 diabetes.",
            "How can I know if I have insulin resistance?",
            "There are no specific symptoms for insulin resistance, but it is often associated with other conditions like obesity, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. A blood test called HbA1c can determine if you have insulin resistance.",
