During the procedure, a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and guided to the heart.   The tip of the catheter delivers radiofrequency energy or extreme cold to the area of the heart causing the arrhythmia.  This energy destroys the tissue causing the arrhythmia, allowing the heart's natural pacemaker to regain control. Recovery time after the procedure can be from a few days to a week.

Pacemakers may also be used to treat other types of arrhythmias. Pacemaker implantation is a common procedure that is performed under local anesthesia.
