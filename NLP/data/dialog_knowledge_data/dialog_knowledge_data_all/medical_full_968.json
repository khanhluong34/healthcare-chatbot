            "How can I lower my risk of developing pneumonia?",
            "Taking immunosuppressive drugs after transplantation increases the risk of pneumonia. It's crucial to follow your doctor's guidelines, practice good hygiene, and avoid close contact with sick individuals to reduce the risk.",

        ],
        "knowledge": "Pneumonia Pneumonia After organ transplantation or in otherwise immunocompromised persons, there are high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when other health problems are present. Different viruses predominate at different times of the year; during flu season, for example, influenza may account for more than half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occur occasionally, including hantaviruses and coronaviruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can also result in pneumonia. Fungal pneumonia is uncommon, but occurs more commonly in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It is most often caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and Coccidioides immitis Pneumonia Pneumonia",
        "response": "Common symptoms of pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals include fever, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue."
