Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when an allergen, such as nickel, is in direct contact with the skin.  Irritant contact dermatitis occurs when a substance damages the skin's protective barrier.  Treatment of contact dermatitis involves avoiding the irritant or allergen and using topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and itching.
