        "knowledge": "Obesity Obesity Obesity is a complex public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects.  As such, managing it requires changes in the wider societal context and effort by communities, local authorities, and governments.  Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population.  Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity.  Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools.  The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks.
