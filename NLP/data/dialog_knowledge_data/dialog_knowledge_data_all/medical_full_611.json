The vaccine is recommended annually because the virus changes frequently.  The vaccine can be given as an injection or as a nasal spray.  The injection contains inactivated virus, so it cannot cause the flu.  The nasal spray contains live attenuated virus that is weakened so that it cannot cause the flu in healthy people.  Vaccination can reduce the risk of getting the flu, and if you do get the flu, it can reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. Influenza Influenza",
