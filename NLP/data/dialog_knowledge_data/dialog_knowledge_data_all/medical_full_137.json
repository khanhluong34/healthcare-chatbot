        "knowledge": "Surgery Surgery Surgery is a medical procedure in which a surgeon makes incisions in the body to repair or remove damaged or diseased tissue.  Some surgeries are minimally invasive, while others require a more invasive approach.  Recovery time can vary depending on the type of surgery and the individual patient.  In general, it's important to rest and take it easy during the first few days after surgery.  Your doctor may recommend some exercises or physical therapy to help with your recovery.  It's also important to eat a healthy and balanced diet, avoid smoking and alcohol, and follow any other instructions provided by your doctor.  Be sure to keep any follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor your progress. Surgery Surgery",
