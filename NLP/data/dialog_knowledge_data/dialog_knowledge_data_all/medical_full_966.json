Bacteria are the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in nearly 50% of cases. Other commonly isolated bacteria include Haemophilus influenzae in 20%, Chlamydophila pneumoniae in 13%, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 3% of cases; Staphylococcus aureus; Moraxella catarrhalis; and Legionella pneumophila. A number of drug-resistant versions of the above infections are becoming more common, including drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia Pneumonia",

It was first identified in 1976 after an outbreak at a convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia.  Legionnaires' disease is usually caused by inhaling aerosolized water droplets contaminated with Legionella bacteria.  Legionella is found naturally in fresh water environments like lakes and streams, but it can also grow and multiply in man-made water systems such as hot tubs, cooling towers, hot water tanks, and large plumbing systems.  Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include high fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, headache, and shortness of breath.  With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, most people recover from Legionnaires' disease.  Legionnaires' disease can be prevented by maintaining and treating water systems to reduce the risk of Legionella growth Legionnaires' Disease Legionnaires' Disease",
