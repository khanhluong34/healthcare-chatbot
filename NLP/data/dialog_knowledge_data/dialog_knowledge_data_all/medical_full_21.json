Cardiac arrhythmia is often first detected by simple but nonspecific means: auscultation of the heartbeat with a stethoscope, or feeling for peripheral pulses.  These cannot usually diagnose specific arrhythmia but can give a general indication of the heart rate and whether it is regular or irregular.  Not all the electrical impulses of the heart produce audible or palpable beats; in many cardiac arrhythmias, the premature or abnormal beats do not produce an effective pumping action and are experienced as 'skipped' beats. The simplest specific diagnostic test for assessment of heart rhythm is the electrocardiogram.  A Holter monitor is an EKG recorded over a 24-hour period, to detect arrhythmias that may happen briefly and unpredictably throughout the day. A more advanced study of the heart's electrical activity can be performed to assess the source of the aberrant heart beats Arrhythmia Arrhythmia",
