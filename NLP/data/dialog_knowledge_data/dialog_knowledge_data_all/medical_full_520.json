The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist, and can also be analyzed chemically.  When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy.  When only a sample of tissue is removed with preservation of the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called an incisional biopsy or core biopsy.  When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are not extracted, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy. Biopsy Biopsy",
