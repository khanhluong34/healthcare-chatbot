        "knowledge": "Influenza Influenza  The onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific, including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain or aching, a feeling of discomfort, loss of appetite, lack of energy/fatigue, and confusion.  These symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and a stuffy or runny nose.  Coughing is the most common symptom.  Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis, especially in children.  The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 - 8 days.   A 2021 study suggests influenza can cause long lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID. Symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract, but progression to pneumonia is relatively common Influenza Influenza",

            "What causes influenza?",
            "Influenza is caused by a virus that infects the respiratory system. There are many strains of the influenza virus, which is why the flu vaccine needs to be updated each year to protect against the most common strains.",
            "How is it diagnosed?",
            "Influenza can be diagnosed through a rapid influenza diagnostic test or a nucleic acid-based test. The most traditional and considered the gold standard for diagnosing influenza is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which can subtype the virus. ",
