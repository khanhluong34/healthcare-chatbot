Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise. Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist. Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers and with the use of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-2 agonists, or leukotriene modifiers. In more severe cases, biologic therapy or immunotherapy may be recommended. Asthma Asthma",
