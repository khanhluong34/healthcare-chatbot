It can be used to treat many types of cancer, either alone or in combination with other treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy. The side effects of radiation therapy depend on the part of the body being treated and the dose of radiation. Side effects can include fatigue, skin changes, and damage to nearby organs. These side effects can be managed with medications and other treatments. Radiation therapy can also increase the risk of developing other types of cancer later in life Radiation Therapy Radiation Therapy",

They occur when the protective mucus that lines the stomach becomes ineffective, allowing stomach acid to damage the stomach lining. Common causes of stomach ulcers include bacterial infections, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and excessive alcohol consumption. Treatment options for stomach ulcers range from medications to lifestyle changes. Medications include antibiotics to treat infections and proton pump inhibitors to reduce stomach acid. Lifestyle changes include eating a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol and tobacco products, and reducing stress.",

"knowledge": "Cancer Cancer Vickers stated, 'The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been 'disproven'. Survival rates vary by cancer type and by the stage at which it is diagnosed, ranging from majority survival to complete mortality five years after diagnosis. Once a cancer has metastasized, prognosis normally becomes much worse. About half of patients receiving treatment for invasive cancer die from that cancer or its treatment. A majority of cancer deaths are due to metastases of the primary tumor. Survival is worse in the developing world, partly because the types of cancer that are most common there are harder to treat than those associated with developed countries. Those who survive cancer develop a second primary cancer at about twice the rate of those never diagnosed.",

    "knowledge": "Cancer Cancer  The increased risk is believed to be due to the random chance of developing any cancer, the likelihood of surviving the first cancer, the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, unwanted side effects of treating the first cancer , and better compliance with screening. Predicting short- or long-term survival depends on many factors.  The most important are the cancer type and the patient's age and overall health.  Those who are frail with other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people.  Centenarians are unlikely to survive for five years even if treatment is successful.  People who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer.  People with lower quality of life may be affected by depression and other complications and/or disease progression that both impairs quality and quantity of life Cancer Cancer",

Hippocrates  described several kinds of cancer, referring to them with the Greek word καρκίνος karkinos .  This name comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumor, with 'the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet, whence it derives its name'.  Galen stated that 'cancer of the breast is so called because of the fancied resemblance to a crab given by the lateral prolongations of the tumor and the adjacent distended veins'. : 738  Celsus  translated karkinos into the Latin cancer, also meaning crab and recommended surgery as treatment.
