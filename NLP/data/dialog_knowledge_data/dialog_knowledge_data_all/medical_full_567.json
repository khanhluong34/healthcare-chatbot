Eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes foods rich in vitamins and minerals can help your body heal. Engaging in light exercise, like walking, can also help improve blood flow and aid in the healing process. It is best to follow the advice of your doctor or surgeon for post-operative care. Additionally, it's important to avoid foods that are high in saturated fat and sugar. These foods can increase inflammation and slow the healing process. Staying hydrated is also important for proper healing.",
