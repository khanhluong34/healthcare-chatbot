It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates.  Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate.  There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load, making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important.
