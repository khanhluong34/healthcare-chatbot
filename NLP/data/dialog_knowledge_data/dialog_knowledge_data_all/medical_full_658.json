Furthermore, pigs, along with bats and quails, are recognized as a mixing vessel of influenza viruses because they have both \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tract.  Because of that, both avian and mammalian influenza viruses can infect pigs.  If co-infection occurs, then reassortment is possible.  A notable example of this was the reassortment of a swine, avian, and human influenza virus in 2009, resulting in a novel H1N1 strain that caused the 2009 flu pandemic Influenza Influenza",
