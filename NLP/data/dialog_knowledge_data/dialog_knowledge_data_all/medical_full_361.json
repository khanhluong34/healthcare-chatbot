Hepatitis can be classified into five categories: hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.  As the inflammation progresses, patients can develop constitutional symptoms similar to acute hepatitis, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and joint pain.  Jaundice can occur as well, but much later in the disease process and is typically a sign of advanced disease.  Chronic hepatitis interferes with hormonal functions of the liver which can result in acne, hirsutism , and amenorrhea  in women.  Extensive damage and scarring of the liver over time defines cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver's ability to function is permanently impeded.  This results in jaundice, weight loss, coagulopathy, ascites , and peripheral edema .  Cirrhosis can lead to other life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices,  hepatorenal syndrome, and liver cancer.
