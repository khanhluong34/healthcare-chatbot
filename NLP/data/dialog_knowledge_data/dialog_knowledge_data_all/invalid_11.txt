These symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and a stuffy or runny nose.  Coughing is the most common symptom.  Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis, especially in children.  The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 - 8 days.

It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture. Epidemiology, or the study and analysis of who, why and where disease occurs, and what determines whether various populations have a disease, is another important tool used to understand infectious disease.  Epidemiologists may determine differences among groups within a population, such as whether certain age groups have a greater or lesser rate of infection; whether groups living in different neighborhoods are more likely to be infected; and by other factors, such as gender and race.  Researchers also may assess whether a disease outbreak is sporadic, or just an occasional occurrence; endemic, with a steady level of regular cases occurring in a region; epidemic, with a fast arising, and unusually high number of cases in a region; or pandemic, which is a global epidemic.  If the cause of the infectious disease is unknown, epidemiology can be used to assist with tracking down the sources of infection.

    ],
    "knowledge": "Viral infections Viral infections are caused by viruses that are microscopic infectious agents.  They can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.  Viruses are not capable of replicating on their own, and instead reproduce by hijacking the host cell machinery.  Once inside, they take over the host cell's resources to make copies of themselves and produce new viruses.  This often leads to cell destruction and the development of symptoms such as fever, headache, and body aches. Viral infections can be prevented by maintaining good hygiene practices such as washing hands regularly, avoiding close contact with sick people, and getting vaccinated when possible.

        "What are the most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine?",
        "Some of the most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include penicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines.",
        "Do all infections require treatment with antibiotics?",
        "No, not all infections require treatment with antibiotics. For many self-limiting infections, the treatment may cause more side-effects than benefits. Antibiotics should only be used when there is a known or highly suspected pathogen that will respond to the medication.",
        "I see. What is antimicrobial stewardship?",
        "Antimicrobial stewardship is the concept that healthcare providers should treat an infection with an antimicrobial that specifically works well for the target pathogen for the shortest amount of time. This helps to reduce the risk of developing antibiotic resistance and side effects from unnecessary antibiotic use.",
        "Thanks for the explanation, Medi.",

    "knowledge": "Antibiotic resistance Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health problem that is caused by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.  When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, they can develop resistance to them, which means that the antibiotics no longer work.  This can lead to the development of superbugs that are resistant to multiple types of antibiotics.  To prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, it is important to use antibiotics only when they are necessary and to take them exactly as prescribed.  Antibiotics should not be used to treat viral infections, and they should not be shared with others or saved for later use.  Good hygiene practices can also help prevent the spread of infections and reduce the need for antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance",

A fever occurs when the body's immune system recognizes a foreign invader and initiates a response.  This response includes the release of chemicals, called pyrogens, which help the body fight off the invader.  Pyrogens cause the body's temperature to increase, which helps to create an environment that is hostile to the invader.  Fever is usually a sign that the body is fighting off an infection.  Most fevers are harmless and go away on their own after a few days.  However, if a fever is very high or lasts for an extended period, it can cause serious health problems. Fever Fever",

Medi: Based on your symptoms, you may have an infection. You should rest and take over-the-counter pain relievers. If your condition worsens, you should seek medical attention.
Patient: What kind of infection?
Medi: It's hard to say without running some tests. But increasing pain makes infection much more likely, and the absence of pain does not rule out infection.

Disease can arise if the host's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host.  Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes.  For example, Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles, and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis.  Not all infectious agents cause disease in all hosts.  For example, less than 5% of individuals infected with polio develop disease.  On the other hand, some infectious agents are highly virulent Infectious diseases Infectious diseases

"knowledge": "Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis  being the principal types.  Crohn's disease affects the small intestine and large intestine, as well as the mouth, esophagus, stomach and the anus, whereas ulcerative colitis primarily affects the colon and the rectum. In spite of Crohn's and UC being very different diseases, both may present with any of the following symptoms: abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, severe internal cramps/muscle spasms in the region of the pelvis and weight loss.  Anemia is the most prevalent extraintestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease.  Associated complaints or diseases include arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and non-thyroidal illness syndrome .  Associations with deep vein thrombosis  and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia  have also been reported.  Diagnosis is generally by assessment of inflammatory markers in stool followed by colonoscopy with biopsy of pathological lesions Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease",

It is even speculated that an effective 'immunization' procedure could be developed—by ingesting the cocktail at an early age. Prebiotics and probiotics are focusing increasing interest as treatments for IBD. Currently, there is evidence to support the use of certain probiotics in addition to standard treatments in people with ulcerative colitis but there is no sufficient data to recommend probiotics in people with Crohn's disease. Both single strain and multi-strain probiotics have been researched for mild to moderate cases of ulcerative colitis. The most clinically researched multi-strain probiotic with over 70 human trials is the De Simone Formulation. Further research is required to identify specific probiotic strains or their combinations and prebiotic substances for therapies of intestinal inflammation Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease",

    "knowledge": "Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease Oxidative DNA damage as measured by 8-OHdG levels was found to be significantly increased in patients with IBD compared to control patients, and in inflamed mucosa compared with non-inflamed mucosa. A genetic component to IBD has been recognized for over a century. Research that has contributed to understanding of the genetics include studies of ethnic groups, familial clustering, epidemiological studies, and twin studies. With the advent of molecular genetics, understanding of the genetic basis has expanded considerably, particularly in the past decade. The first gene linked to IBD was NOD2 in 2001. Genome-wide association studies have since added to understanding of the genomics and pathogenesis of the disease. More than 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms are now known to be associated with susceptibility to IBD Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease",

During antigenic shift, antigenically different strains that infect the same cell can reassort genome segments with each other, producing hybrid progeny.

If an animal strain reassorts with a human strain, then a novel strain can emerge that is capable of human-to-human transmission.  This has caused pandemics, but only a limited number have occurred, so it is difficult to predict when the next will happen. People who are infected can transmit influenza viruses through breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing, which spread respiratory droplets and aerosols that contain virus particles into the air.  A person susceptible to infection can then contract influenza by coming into contact with these particles.  Respiratory droplets are relatively large and travel less than two meters before falling onto nearby surfaces.  Aerosols are smaller and remain suspended in the air longer, so they take longer to settle and can travel further than respiratory droplets Influenza Influenza",

Severe respiratory illness can be caused by multiple, non-exclusive mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity due to epithelial cell infection and death, and degradation of the extracellular matrix that maintains lung structure.  In particular, alveolar cell infection appears to drive severe symptoms since this results in impaired gas exchange and enables viruses to infect endothelial cells, which produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pneumonia caused by influenza viruses is characterized by high levels of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, accompanied by a strong pro-inflammatory response called a cytokine storm.  Infection with H5N1 or H7N9 especially produces high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  In bacterial infections, early depletion of macrophages during influenza creates a favorable environment in the lungs for bacterial growth since these white blood cells are important in responding to bacterial infection.  Host mechanisms to encourage tissue repair may inadvertently allow bacterial infection Influenza Influenza",

In particular, alveolar cell infection appears to drive severe symptoms since this results in impaired gas exchange and enables viruses to infect endothelial cells, which produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pneumonia caused by influenza viruses is characterized by high levels of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, accompanied by a strong pro-inflammatory response called a cytokine storm.  Infection with H5N1 or H7N9 especially produces high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  In bacterial infections, early depletion of macrophages during influenza creates a favorable environment in the lungs for bacterial growth since these white blood cells are important in responding to bacterial infection.  Host mechanisms to encourage tissue repair may inadvertently allow bacterial infection Influenza Influenza",
    "response": "Yes, some foods that are good for lung health include leafy greens like spinach and kale, citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruits, and nuts like almonds and walnuts."

    "knowledge": "Influenza Influenza  Interferons mediate expression of antiviral proteins and proteins that recruit immune cells to the infection site, and they also notify nearby uninfected cells of infection.  Some infected cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection.  Immune cells control viral infection by killing infected cells and phagocytizing viral particles and apoptotic cells.  An exacerbated immune response, however, can harm the host organism through a cytokine storm.  To counter the immune response, influenza viruses encode various non-structural proteins, including NS1, NEP, PB1-F2, and PA-X, that are involved in curtailing the host immune response by suppressing interferon production and host gene expression. B cells, a type of white blood cell, produce antibodies that bind to influenza antigens HA and NA  and other proteins to a lesser degree.  Once bound to these proteins, antibodies block virions from binding to cellular receptors, neutralizing the virus Influenza Influenza",

Secondary pneumonia typically has a period of improvement in symptoms for 1–3 weeks followed by recurrent fever, sputum production, and fluid buildup in the lungs, but can also occur just a few days after influenza symptoms appear.  About a third of primary pneumonia cases are followed by secondary pneumonia, which is most frequently caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus.

Each of the four species is the sole member of its own genus, and the four influenza genera comprise four of the seven genera in the family Orthomyxoviridae Influenza Influenza",

In 2011, IDV was discovered in pigs in Oklahoma, USA, and cattle were later identified as the primary reservoir of IDV.  In the same year, avian H7N9 was detected in China and began to cause human infections in 2013, starting in Shanghai and Anhui and remaining mostly in China.  HPAI H7N9 emerged sometime in 2016 and has occasionally infected humans incidentally.  Other AIVs have less commonly infected humans since the 1990s, including H5N6, H6N1, H7N2-4, H7N7, and H10N7-8, and HPAI H subtypes such as H5N1-3, H5N5-6, and H5N8 have begun to spread throughout much of the world since the 2010s.  Future flu pandemics, which may be caused by an influenza virus of avian origin, are viewed as almost inevitable, and increased globalization has made it easier for novel viruses to spread, so there are continual efforts to prepare for future pandemics and improve the prevention and treatment of influenza.

        "knowledge": "Carbon monoxide poisoning Carbon monoxide poisoning  Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a potentially fatal illness caused by exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide gas.  Symptoms of CO poisoning are often described as "flu-like" and commonly include headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion.  In severe cases, loss of consciousness or death can occur.  CO poisoning can be prevented by installing a CO detector in your home or work place and by having your heating system, chimney, and flue inspected annually.  Avoid running automobiles or gasoline-powered equipment in enclosed spaces such as garages or basements. Carbon monoxide poisoning Carbon monoxide poisoning",

    "knowledge": "Influenza Influenza  The onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific, including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain or aching, a feeling of discomfort, loss of appetite, lack of energy/fatigue, and confusion.  These symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and a stuffy or runny nose.  Coughing is the most common symptom.  Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis, especially in children.  The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 - 8 days.   A 2021 study suggests influenza can cause long lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID. Symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract, but progression to pneumonia is relatively common Influenza Influenza",

        "Hi there, Medi. I have a question about influenza.",
        "Sure, what's your question?",
        "Can influenza infect other animals besides humans?",
        "Yes, influenza viruses can infect other animals such as dogs, seals, whales, and minks.",
        "What about birds?",
        "Yes, birds can also be infected with influenza viruses. In fact, it's also known as avian influenza.",
        "How does this happen?",
        "Influenza viruses can undergo reassortment and mutations that allow them to infect different species.",
        "Thank you for the information, Medi."
    ],
    "knowledge": "Influenza Influenza  H3N2 has a much broader host range and can reassort with H1N1 and H5N1.  An isolated case of H6N1 likely from a chicken was found infecting a dog, so other AIVs may emerge in canines. Other mammals to be infected by IAVs include H7N7 and H4N5 in seals, H1N3 in whales, and H10N4 and H3N2 in minks.  Various mutations have been identified that are associated with AIVs adapting to mammals.  Since HA proteins vary in which sialic acids they bind to, mutations in the HA receptor binding site can allow AIVs to infect mammals.  Other mutations include mutations affecting which sialic acids NA proteins cleave and a mutation in the PB2 polymerase subunit that improves tolerance of lower temperatures in mammalian respiratory tracts and enhances RNP assembly by stabilizing NP and PB2 binding. IBV is mainly found in humans but has also been detected in pigs, dogs, horses, and seals Influenza Influenza",
