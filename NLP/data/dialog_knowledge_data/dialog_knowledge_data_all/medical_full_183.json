People may become anxious or depressed post-diagnosis. The risk of suicide in people with cancer is approximately double. Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration.",

Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps",
            "Wow, I didn't realize there were so many different symptoms. Is there anything I can do to reduce my risk of cancer?",
