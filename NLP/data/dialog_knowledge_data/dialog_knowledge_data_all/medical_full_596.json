Risk factors include cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, and a weak immune system.  Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination.  Chest X-ray, CT scan, and blood tests may also help confirm the diagnosis.  Treatment depends on the underlying cause.  Bacterial pneumonia is typically treated with antibiotics while viral pneumonia is treated with antiviral medication.  Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low.
