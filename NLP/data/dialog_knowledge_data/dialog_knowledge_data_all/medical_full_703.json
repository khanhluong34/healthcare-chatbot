Bacterial meningitis is the most severe form and can be fatal if not treated immediately. Viral meningitis is less severe than bacterial meningitis and usually goes away on its own. Fungal meningitis is rare and typically affects people with weakened immune systems.",

            "Yes, there are vaccines available for bacterial meningitis. The vaccine is recommended for people who are at high risk of developing the disease, such as college students living in dormitories and people with weakened immune systems. There are no vaccines for viral or fungal meningitis, but taking preventive measures such as washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact with people who have meningitis can reduce the risk of infection.",
