The test is limited to a three-month average because the lifespan of a red blood cell is four months.  Glycated hemoglobin is formed by the non-enzymatic glycation of hemoglobin by glucose.  Glycated hemoglobin normally constitutes 4-6% of total hemoglobin.  The American Diabetes Association and the World Health Organization have standardized the measurement of glycated hemoglobin since 1993.  Normally, glycated hemoglobin levels of less than 5.7% are considered normal, and levels between 5.7% and 6.4% are considered to indicate prediabetes or an increased risk for developing diabetes.
