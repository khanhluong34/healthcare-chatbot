It's commonly used to screen for colon cancer and to investigate symptoms like abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and changes in bowel habits.  During a colonoscopy, a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end is inserted through the rectum and guided through the colon.  The camera sends images to a monitor, which allows the doctor to examine the lining of the colon.  If any abnormalities are found, the doctor can take tissue samples or remove polyps.  A colonoscopy typically takes 30 - 60 minutes and requires some preparation beforehand, like a special diet and bowel prep.  Afterward, you may experience bloating, gas, or cramping, but these symptoms should go away in a day. Colonoscopy Colonoscopy",
