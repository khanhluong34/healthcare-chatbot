        "knowledge": "Coronary artery bypass surgery Coronary artery bypass surgery  Coronary artery bypass surgery, also known as coronary artery bypass grafting, is a surgical procedure that diverts blood around narrowed or clogged parts of the major arteries to improve blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart.  This surgery is performed when one or more of the coronary arteries becomes partially or completely blocked, typically due to a buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries.  The surgery involves taking a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body and attaching it to the blocked artery to bypass the blocked area.  After surgery, patients typically stay in the hospital for several days and then must gradually resume their normal activities.  Patients will typically be advised to avoid strenuous activity for several weeks after the surgery.  They may also be prescribed medications to help control their cholesterol levels and prevent blood clots.
