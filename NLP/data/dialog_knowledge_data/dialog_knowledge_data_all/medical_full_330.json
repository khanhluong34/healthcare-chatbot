Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes , evidence of cellular injury and cell death , evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies. Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.  In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.  For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.  In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.  Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis Hepatitis Hepatitis",
