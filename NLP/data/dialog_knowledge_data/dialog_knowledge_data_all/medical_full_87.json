It is usually done to diagnose or treat conditions like lung infections, tumors, or other lung diseases. The procedure involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera and light source through the mouth or nose and into the lungs. The doctor can then see the inside of the lungs and take samples of tissue or fluid for testing. The procedure is usually done with sedation or anesthesia to minimize discomfort. It is generally considered safe, but there is a small risk of complications like bleeding or infection. Bronchoscopy Bronchoscopy",
