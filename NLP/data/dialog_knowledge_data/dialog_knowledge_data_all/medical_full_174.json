In 2018, nearly 2.1 million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed, which makes up about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women.  The average five-year survival rate for breast cancer is 90%. Early detection is key to survival, which is why regular mammograms are recommended for women over 50 years of age.  However, breast cancer can also occur in men.  Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer.  Other types include invasive lobular carcinoma, inflammatory breast cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer, to name a few.  Risk factors include age, gender, family history, and certain genetic mutations. Breast Cancer Breast Cancer",
