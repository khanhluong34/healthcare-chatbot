Many types of viruses can cause a common cold.  Children younger than six are at greatest risk of colds, but healthy adults can also expect to have two or three colds annually.  Symptoms usually appear one to three days after exposure to a cold-causing virus.  Symptoms include coughing, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, and fatigue.  Signs and symptoms of a common cold usually clear up within a week to 10 days.  Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses, but over-the-counter medications can help relieve symptoms.  Rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers and decongestants can help relieve cold symptoms. Common Cold Common Cold",

Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They're normally harmless or even helpful, but under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease.  Some infectious diseases can be passed from person to person. Some are transmitted by bites from insects or animals.  Others are acquired by ingesting contaminated food or water.  Symptoms vary depending on the organism causing the infection, but they often include fever and fatigue. Mild infections may respond to rest and home remedies, while some life-threatening infections may require hospitalization.  Infectious diseases can be prevented by vaccination, frequent and thorough hand-washing, and cooking meat and eggs thoroughly. Infectious Diseases Infectious Diseases",
