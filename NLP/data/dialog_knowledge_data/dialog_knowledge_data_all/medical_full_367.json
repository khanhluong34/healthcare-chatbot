        "knowledge": "Hepatitis Hepatitis The next insight regarding hepatitis B was a serendipitous one by Dr.  Baruch Blumberg, a researcher at the NIH who did not set out to research hepatitis, but rather studied lipoprotein genetics.   He travelled across the globe collecting blood samples, investigating the interplay between disease, environment, and genetics with the goal of designing  targeted interventions for at-risk people that could prevent them from getting sick.   He noticed an unexpected interaction between the blood of a patient with hemophilia that had received multiple transfusions and a protein found in the blood of an indigenous Australian person.   He named the protein the 'Australia antigen' and made it the focus of his research.   He found a higher prevalence of the protein in the blood of patients from developing countries, compared to those from developed ones, and noted associations of the antigen with other diseases like leukemia and Down Syndrome.   Eventually, he came to the unifying conclusion that the Australia antigen was associated with viral hepatitis Hepatitis Hepatitis",
