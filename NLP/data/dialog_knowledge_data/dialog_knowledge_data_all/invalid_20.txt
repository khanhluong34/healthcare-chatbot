    "Hi, Medi. I've been experiencing visual disturbances without a headache. What could it be?",
    "It sounds like you may be experiencing a silent migraine or a typical aura without a headache.",
    "Are these symptoms serious? They can be quite scary.",
    "While silent migraines don't involve a headache, they can still be debilitating. They may include visual disturbances, vision loss in half of both eyes, and sensory problems. They usually last for 15 to 30 minutes, sometimes up to 60 minutes.",
    "I see. Can these symptoms recur or appear as isolated events?",
    "Yes, they can. Silent migraines can occur periodically or as isolated events.",
    "Thank you, Medi. One more thing, what are the postdrome symptoms associated with migraines?",
    "The postdrome phase refers to the symptoms that occur after the acute headache has settled. It can include a sore feeling in the area where the migraine was, impaired thinking for a few days, fatigue, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes, and weakness.",
    "That's good to know. Is it normal to feel different emotions after a migraine attack?",
    "Yes, it's quite common. Some people may feel unusually refreshed or euphoric, while others may experience depression and malaise."

    "How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?",
    "I've had them all day long. It started in the morning.",
    "Have you done anything unusual yesterday?",
    "No, not really. I just drank something ice cold, even though it's been cold lately.",

  "knowledge": "Influenza Influenza The onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific, including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain or aching, a feeling of discomfort, loss of appetite, lack of energy/fatigue, and confusion. These symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and a stuffy or runny nose. Coughing is the most common symptom. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis, especially in children. The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 - 8 days. A 2021 study suggests influenza can cause long-lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID. Symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract, but progression to pneumonia is relatively common Influenza Influenza",

    "Yes, there are over 1 billion people who have obesity worldwide.",
    "Do the government or society take any action to prevent its increase?",
    "Yes, they do. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting junk food marketing to children, decreasing access to sugary beverages in schools, and even taxing sugary drinks. Urban environments are also being designed to increase access to parks and pedestrian routes.",
    "That's interesting. Can you tell me more about the actions taken?",

The World Health Organization indicates people worldwide are taking up less active recreational pursuits, while research from Finland found an increase and research from the United States found leisure-time physical activity has not changed significantly.  Physical activity in children may not be a significant contributor. In both children and adults, there is an association between television viewing time and the risk of obesity.  Increased media exposure increases the rate of childhood obesity, with rates increasing proportionally to time spent watching television.

      "Hello, Medi. I have a question about obesity. How does media exposure affect its prevalence?",
      "Great question! Increased media exposure is associated with higher rates of childhood obesity. The more time spent watching television, the greater the risk of obesity. Rates of childhood obesity tend to increase proportionally with the time spent engaging with media.",
      "That's concerning. I didn't realize media could have such an impact. What are the other contributing factors to obesity?",
      "Obesity is a complex condition influenced by various factors. Apart from media exposure, it's important to consider genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in genes controlling appetite and metabolism. Additionally, lifestyle choices, including diet and physical activity, play a significant role.",
      "I see. So, it's a combination of genetics, lifestyle, and media exposure. Are there any preventive measures against obesity?",
      "Preventing obesity involves making positive changes in both individual behaviors and societal factors. It's recommended to adopt a balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, limit media exposure, and promote healthier environments. Public health initiatives also aim to address environmental factors contributing to excess food energy consumption and limited physical activity.",
      "That makes sense. It's good to know that preventive measures are being taken. What actions are being implemented?",
      "Several actions have been implemented, such as federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limitations on junk food marketing to children, and reducing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. There's also a recommendation to tax sugary drinks. Urban planning efforts are focused on creating pedestrian-friendly routes and increasing access to parks.",
      "I appreciate the information, Medi. It's reassuring to see efforts being made to combat obesity. Keep up the good work!",
      "Thank you! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask."

      "Of course! I'm here to assist you. What specific advice or information are you looking for?",
      "I'm curious about the relationship between obesity and physical activity. Can you explain?",
      "Certainly! While global trends in active leisure time physical activity are not clear, the World Health Organization suggests people worldwide are becoming less active. However, research from Finland found an increase, while research from the United States shows no significant change. Physical activity in both children and adults has an association with obesity risk. Increased media exposure, especially TV time, contributes to childhood obesity. It's a combination of genetics and environmental factors.",
      "Interesting. What can I do to improve my lifestyle and reduce obesity?",
      "Making lifestyle changes is crucial. Focus on adopting a balanced diet, reducing calorie intake, and increasing physical activity. It's recommended to limit media exposure, especially television. Regular exercise and incorporating healthy habits into your daily routine will support weight management.",
      "Got it. How can I prevent obesity in the first place?",
      "Preventing obesity involves maintaining a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise. It's also essential to limit sedentary behaviors, especially excessive screen time. Creating a supportive environment at home and fostering healthy habits from a young age can help prevent obesity.",
      "Thank you, Medi. One last question: Are there any specific genes associated with obesity?",
      "Yes, there are polymorphisms in various genes controlling appetite and metabolism that can predispose individuals to obesity when sufficient food energy is present. Genetic factors interact with environmental influences to contribute to the development of obesity.",
      "That's good to know. Thanks for all the information, Medi!"
