The earliest record of an epidemic caused by hepatitis B virus was made by Lurman in 1885.  An outbreak of smallpox occurred in Bremen in 1883 and 1,289 shipyard employees were vaccinated with lymph from other people.  After several weeks, and up to eight months later, 191 of the vaccinated workers became ill with jaundice and were diagnosed with serum hepatitis.  Other employees who had been inoculated with different batches of lymph remained healthy.  Lurman's paper, now regarded as a classical example of an epidemiological study, proved that contaminated lymph was the source of the outbreak Hepatitis B Hepatitis B",
