The procedure involves using an endoscope - a flexible tube with a light and camera attached to it - to look inside the body.  Endoscopies may be performed for a variety of reasons; the most common indications are dyspepsia, colon cancer screening, inflammation of the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine, or bleeding from the upper or lower digestive tract.  The procedure can also be used to collect small tissue samples (biopsies) for further examination and testing. Endoscopy Endoscopy",
