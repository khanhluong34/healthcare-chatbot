After getting the flu shot, it takes about two weeks for your body to develop immunity against the virus. The flu shot is safe for most people, but some people may experience mild side effects, such as soreness at the injection site, fever, and aches. These side effects usually go away on their own within a few days. Influenza Influenza",
