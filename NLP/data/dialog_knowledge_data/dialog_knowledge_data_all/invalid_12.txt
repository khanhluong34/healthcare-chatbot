Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis, especially in children.  The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 - 8 days.

Dialogue 2:
{
    "dialog": ["Hi, can you tell me about the different types of influenza viruses?",
               "Hello! Sure, influenza viruses can be classified by their subtypes and strains. The subtypes in circulation as of 2018 are H1N1 and H3N2, and they can be further classified by natural host species, geographical origin, year of isolation, and strain number.",

               "IAVs can cause both seasonal epidemics and pandemics, have subtypes, and are primarily found in birds and mammals. IBVs contribute to seasonal epidemics alongside IAVs but have never been associated with a pandemic. ICVs are less well-studied and are typically more mild than IAVs.",

IBV mainly infects humans but has been identified in seals, horses, dogs, and pigs.  IBV does not have subtypes like IAV but has two antigenically distinct lineages, termed the B/Victoria/2/1987-like and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like lineages, or simply Victoria and Yamagata.

In the US, where resistance to cefalosporins is increasingly found in streptococci, addition of vancomycin to the initial treatment is recommended.  Chloramphenicol, either alone or in combination with ampicillin, however, appears to work equally well. Empirical therapy may be chosen on the basis of the person's age, whether the infection was preceded by a head injury, whether the person has undergone recent neurosurgery and whether or not a cerebral shunt is present.  In young children and those over 50 years of age, as well as those who are immunocompromised, the addition of ampicillin is recommended to cover Listeria monocytogenes.  Once the Gram stain results become available, and the broad type of bacterial cause is known, it may be possible to change the antibiotics to those likely to deal with the presumed group of pathogens.
