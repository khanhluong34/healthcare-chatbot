It can be caused by a number of factors, such as bacterial infections, excessive alcohol consumption, and prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Symptoms include stomach pain, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment may involve taking antacids and proton pump inhibitors to reduce stomach acid, as well as antibiotics to eradicate any bacterial infections. It is also important to avoid alcohol and NSAIDs to allow the stomach lining to heal. Gastritis can cause serious complications if left untreated, such as stomach ulcers and even stomach cancer.",

For certain types of cancer, such as early head and neck cancer, it may be used alone. For painful bone metastasis, it has been found to be effective in about 70% of patients.
