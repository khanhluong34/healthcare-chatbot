When an entire chamber of the heart is involved in multiple micro-re-entry circuits and is, therefore, quivering with chaotic electrical impulses, it is said to be in fibrillation. Fibrillation can affect the atrium or the ventricle: ventricular fibrillation is imminently life-threatening.

Defibrillation is performed by applying an electric shock to the heart, which resets the cells, permitting a normal beat to re-establish itself.

            "Yes, fibrillation can affect both the atrium and ventricle, but ventricular fibrillation is the most dangerous one, which can be life-threatening.",
            "What should I do if someone experiences ventricular fibrillation?",
            "Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency condition, and the only way to restore a normal heart rhythm is by defibrillation. This procedure involves applying an electric shock to the heart to reset the cells and allow the heart to beat normally again. It's important to call emergency services immediately if someone experiences ventricular fibrillation.",

        "knowledge": "Arrhythmia Arrhythmia Although omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil can be protective against arrhythmias, they can facilitate re-entrant arrhythmias. When an entire chamber of the heart is involved in multiple micro-re-entry circuits and is, therefore, quivering with chaotic electrical impulses, it is said to be in fibrillation. Fibrillation can affect the atrium  or the ventricle : ventricular fibrillation is imminently life-threatening. CPR can prolong the survival of the brain in the lack of a normal pulse, but defibrillation is the only intervention that can restore a healthy heart rhythm.  Defibrillation is performed by applying an electric shock to the heart, which resets the cells, permitting a normal beat to re-establish itself. Triggered beats occur when problems at the level of the ion channels in individual heart cells result in abnormal propagation of electrical activity and can lead to a sustained abnormal rhythm.  They are relatively rare and can result from the action of anti-arrhythmic drugs, or after depolarizations Arrhythmia Arrhythmia",
        "response": "Those are all great ways to reduce your risk of arrhythmia. By making healthy choices, you can improve your overall heart health."

            "What kind of instructions should I expect?",
            "Your doctor may advise you to rest for a certain amount of time, avoid strenuous activity, and take medication as prescribed.",
            "What about my diet?",
            "Your doctor may recommend a heart-healthy diet that is low in salt and saturated fat.",
            "Okay, thank you for the advice, Medi."
