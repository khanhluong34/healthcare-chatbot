The typical duration of a cold is around 7\u201310 days, with symptom onset occurring 1\u20133 days after exposure to the virus. The best way to prevent a cold is to wash your hands frequently, avoid close contact with sick people, and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. Cold treatment is mainly supportive care, such as rest and fluid intake, pain relief medication, and nasal drops.",

These changes can be caused by mutations that occur when the virus replicates itself. Since the surface proteins of the virus are what the immune system recognizes, changes in these proteins can allow the virus to evade the immune system and cause new infections.",
            "That's interesting. Why does this happen?",
            "This happens because the immune system is constantly adapting to recognize and fight off new strains of the virus. As the virus changes, the immune system may not recognize it as easily, which allows the virus to infect more people.",
            "So what can we do to prevent this?",
