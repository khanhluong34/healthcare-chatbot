Responsive prevention and treatment of migraine is incredibly important because evidence shows an increased sensitivity after each successive attack, eventually leading to chronic daily migraine in some individuals. Repeated migraine results in reorganization of brain circuitry, causing profound functional as well as structural changes in the brain. One of the most important problems in clinical migraine is the progression from an intermittent, self-limited inconvenience to a life-changing disorder of chronic pain, sensory amplification, and autonomic and affective disruption. This progression, sometimes termed chronification in the migraine literature, is common, affecting 3% of migraineurs in a given year, such that 8% of migraineurs have chronic migraine in any given year. Brain imagery reveals that the electrophysiological changes seen during an attack become permanent in people with chronic migraine; thus, from an electrophysiological point of view, chronic migraine indeed resembles a never-ending migraine attack Migraine Migraine",

It's common to experience changes in bowel movements, but most people can resume a normal diet without any major issues.
