The atrioventricular node, located in the lower atrial septum, delays the impulse for 0.12-0.2 seconds to allow the atria to contract first.  This delay in conduction allows the ventricles to fill with blood before contracting.  The impulse then travels down the Bundle of His, which divides into the left and right bundle branches.

            "Hi Medi, can you tell me more about Long QT syndrome?",
            "Sure. Long QT syndrome is a complex problem in the heart that has been linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.",
            "How is Long QT syndrome diagnosed?",
            "It can be diagnosed through an electrocardiogram, or ECG, which measures the electrical activity of the heart. Genetic testing can also be done to determine if a person has the gene mutation associated with Long QT syndrome.",
            "What are the treatments for Long QT syndrome?",
            "Treatment can include medications, such as beta-blockers, to slow the heart rate and reduce the risk of arrhythmias. Lifestyle changes, such as reducing stress and avoiding certain medications, can also be helpful. In some cases, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator may be necessary to help regulate the heart's rhythm.",
            "Thank you for explaining that, Medi. What are some lifestyle changes I can make to reduce the risk of Long QT syndrome?",
            "Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, reducing stress, and avoiding certain medications can help to reduce the risk of Long QT syndrome.",

            "Hey Medi, I recently had a cardiac ablation and I'm not sure what lifestyle changes I need to make.",
            "Hi there. After a cardiac ablation, it's important to avoid strenuous activities for a period of time. You should also avoid smoking and drinking alcohol, and try to maintain a healthy diet.",
            "What kind of exercise can I do after a cardiac ablation?",
            "Low-impact exercises like walking or swimming are good options. You should avoid high-intensity activities or weightlifting until your doctor gives you the all-clear.",
            "Are there any medications I should avoid after a cardiac ablation?",
            "Your doctor may advise you to avoid certain medications, such as blood thinners, for a period of time after the procedure. Be sure to follow your doctor's instructions carefully.",
            "Thank you for your advice, Medi. What else should I be aware of after a cardiac ablation?",
