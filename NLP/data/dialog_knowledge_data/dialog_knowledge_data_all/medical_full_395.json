Carriers who have seroconverted to HBeAg negative status, in particular those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others. However, it is possible for individuals to enter an 'immune escape' with HBeAg-negative hepatitis. PCR tests have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens.

            "Of course, I'm here to help. What would you like to know about hepatitis B?",
            "What are the symptoms of hepatitis B? I want to be aware of them.",
            "Symptoms of hepatitis B can vary, but they may include fatigue, abdominal pain, dark urine, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and loss of appetite. Some people may not experience any symptoms at all but can still carry the virus.",
            "I see. How is hepatitis B transmitted?",
            "Hepatitis B can be transmitted through contact with infected blood or body fluids. This can happen through sexual contact, sharing needles or syringes, getting a tattoo or piercing with unsterilized equipment, or from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth.",
            "Is there a vaccine for hepatitis B?",
            "Yes, vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B have been routinely recommended for babies since 1991 in the United States. Vaccination is also recommended for adults who may be at risk of exposure to the virus.",
            "Thank you for the information, Medi. One last question, can hepatitis B be cured?"
