            "Hi Medi, I recently had a sinus surgery. Any advice on post-operative care?",
            "Certainly! After sinus surgery, it's important to keep the surgical site clean and moist. Follow your doctor's instructions regarding nasal rinses and saline sprays.",
            "Are there any dietary restrictions I should follow?",
            "In general, it's a good idea to avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeine for a few days after surgery. These can irritate the nasal passages and slow down the healing process.",
            "Can I exercise after sinus surgery?",
            "It's best to avoid strenuous exercise for at least a week after surgery to allow your body to heal. Gentle activities like walking are usually fine.",
            "How long does it take to fully recover from sinus surgery?",
            "The recovery time can vary, but most people can resume their normal activities within 1-2 weeks. However, it may take several months for complete healing.",
            "Thank you for the guidance, Medi. Is there anything else I should be aware of?"

        "knowledge": "Sinusitis Sinusitis Because of increasing resistance to amoxicillin the 2012 guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate as the initial treatment of choice for bacterial sinusitis. The guidelines also recommend against other commonly used antibiotics, including azithromycin, clarithromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, because of growing antibiotic resistance. The FDA recommends against the use of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. A short-course of antibiotics seems to be just as effective as the typical longer-course of antibiotics for those with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis without any other severe disease or complicating factors. The IDSA guideline suggests five to seven days of antibiotics is long enough to treat a bacterial infection without encouraging resistance. The guidelines still recommend children receive antibiotic treatment for ten days to two weeks. For unconfirmed acute sinusitis, nasal sprays using corticosteroids have not been found to be better than a placebo either alone or in combination with antibiotics Sinusitis Sinusitis",
