Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, and older age.  About 5-10% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others.  Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk.  Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas.  Medications or surgery can be used to prevent the development of breast cancer in those who are at high risk.  Treatment may include surgery, medications, radiation, and chemotherapy. ",
