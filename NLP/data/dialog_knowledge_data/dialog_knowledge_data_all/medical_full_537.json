Normal body temperature is between 97\u00b0F and 99\u00b0F. A fever can be caused by many different infections ranging from the common cold to more severe infections such as COVID-19. In some cases, a fever can signal a more serious issue that requires medical attention. Treatment for a fever typically includes rest and drinking plenty of fluids. If your fever is high, you may also need to take medication to lower it.",

The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen depend upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen. However, a host's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection. Clinicians, therefore, classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses \u2013 either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens.
