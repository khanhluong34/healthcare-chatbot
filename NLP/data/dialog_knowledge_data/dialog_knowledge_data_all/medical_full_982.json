Evidence is inconclusive on whether anti-fungal treatments improve symptoms or quality of life. Most sinusitis cases are caused by viruses and resolve without antibiotics.  However, if symptoms do not resolve within 10 days, either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate are reasonable antibiotics for first treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate being slightly superior to amoxicillin alone but with more side effects.
