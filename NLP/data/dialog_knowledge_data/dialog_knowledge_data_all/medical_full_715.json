        "knowledge": "Meningitis Meningitis Severe meningococcal and pneumococcal infections may result in hemorrhaging of the adrenal glands, leading to Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, which is often fatal. The brain tissue may swell, pressure inside the skull may increase and the swollen brain may herniate through the skull base. This may be noticed by a decreasing level of consciousness, loss of the pupillary light reflex, and abnormal posturing. The inflammation of the brain tissue may also obstruct the normal flow of CSF around the brain. Seizures may occur for various reasons; in children, seizures are common in the early stages of meningitis and do not necessarily indicate an underlying cause. Seizures may result from increased pressure and from areas of inflammation in the brain tissue. Focal seizures, persistent seizures, late-onset seizures and those that are difficult to control with medication indicate a poorer long-term outcome Meningitis Meningitis",
