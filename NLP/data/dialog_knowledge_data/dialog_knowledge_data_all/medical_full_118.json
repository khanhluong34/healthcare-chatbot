Migraines are often one-sided and can last from a few hours to several days. Some people experience aura before the onset of their migraine, which can make them feel dizzy or see flashes of light. The cause of migraines is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the face and head. Migraines can be triggered by various factors such as stress, certain foods, lack of sleep, and hormonal changes in women. Migraine Migraine",
