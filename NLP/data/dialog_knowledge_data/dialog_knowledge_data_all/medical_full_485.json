Blood pressure is expressed by two measurements, the systolic and diastolic pressures, which are the maximum and minimum pressures, respectively, in the arterial system. Hypertension is classified as either primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension; about 90\u201395% of cases are categorized as primary hypertension, which means high blood pressure with no obvious underlying medical cause. Risk factors for developing hypertension include a family history of hypertension, age, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, high salt intake, excessive alcohol consumption, stress, and certain medical conditions.
