Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue. Influenza spreads from person to person through droplets when coughing, sneezing, or talking. It can also spread by touching a surface or object with the virus on it and then touching one's mouth, nose, or eyes. The best way to prevent the spread of influenza is by getting vaccinated every year, washing your hands frequently, covering your coughs and sneezes, staying home when you are sick, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.",
