            "What makes type A and B viruses different from each other?",
            "Type A viruses are more likely to cause pandemics because they can infect both animals and humans, while type B viruses only infect humans. Type A viruses are also divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus. The subtypes can change due to genetic mutations, leading to new strains of influenza viruses.",

            "A test called a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) can be used to detect influenza viruses in respiratory secretions. RIDTs give results within 15-30 minutes. However, RIDTs are not as accurate as other laboratory tests like RT-PCR, which can detect influenza viruses more accurately.",

        "knowledge": "Influenza Influenza  Influenza vaccines have been developed to protect people against infection with influenza viruses.  Vaccines are available for the seasonal influenza viruses that circulate each year and for several avian influenza viruses that have caused human infections.  Influenza vaccines are usually trivalent or quadrivalent, containing two influenza A virus subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and one or two influenza B virus lineages.  Vaccine efficacy varies from year to year and depends on several factors, including the degree of match between the vaccine strains and the circulating viruses and the age and immune status of the vaccine recipient.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that influenza vaccines reduce the risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from influenza by 40-60% on average.
