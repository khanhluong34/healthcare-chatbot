Communicable diseases are similar, but specifically refer to diseases that can be transmitted from one person to another through direct or indirect means. Contagious diseases are a subtype of infectious diseases that are particularly easy to spread.",

            "Of course, that's a smart idea. After surgery, it's important to eat foods that are easy to digest and won't cause any irritation. Try to stick with bland foods like rice, toast, and bananas. You should also avoid spicy or acidic foods.",
            "Okay, I can do that. Should I be eating more or less than usual?",
            "It depends on your appetite. It's important to eat enough to provide your body with the nutrients it needs to heal, but don't force yourself to eat if you're not hungry. It's also important to stay hydrated, so make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids.",
