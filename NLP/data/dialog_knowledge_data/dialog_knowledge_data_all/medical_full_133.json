It is triggered by eating foods containing gluten, which is found in wheat, barley, and rye. Symptoms can vary but may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, fatigue, and weight loss. Currently, there is no cure for celiac disease. However, it can be managed by adopting a gluten-free diet, which requires avoiding all foods that contain gluten or are contaminated with gluten. This may include bread, pasta, baked goods, and certain processed foods. Gluten-free alternatives include fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, dairy products, and gluten-free grains like rice and quinoa.
