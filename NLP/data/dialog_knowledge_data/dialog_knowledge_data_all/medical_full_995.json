In rare instances, these infections may involve the orbit, causing orbital cellulitis, which may in turn result in blindness or determine central nervous system complications such as meningitis, subdural empyema, brain abscess, and life-threatening cavernous sinus thrombosis. Infection of the eye socket is a rare complication of ethmoid sinusitis, which may result in the loss of sight and is accompanied by fever and severe illness Sinusitis Sinusitis",
