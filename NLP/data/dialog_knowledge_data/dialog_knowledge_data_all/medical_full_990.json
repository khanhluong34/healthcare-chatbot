        "knowledge": "Sinusitis Sinusitis Acute sinusitis may be accompanied by a thick nasal discharge that is usually green in color, and may contain pus or blood. Often, a localized headache or toothache is present, and these symptoms distinguish a sinus-related headache from other types of headaches, such as tension and migraine headaches. Another way to distinguish between toothache and sinusitis is that the pain in sinusitis is usually worsened by tilting the head forward and with the Valsalva maneuver. Other symptoms associated with acute rhinosinusitis include cough, fatigue, hyposmia, anosmia and ear fullness or pressure. Sinus infections can also cause middle-ear problems due to the congestion of the nasal passages. This can be demonstrated by dizziness, 'a pressurized or heavy head', or vibrating sensations in the head. Postnasal drip is also a symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis Sinusitis Sinusitis",
