    "knowledge": "Mental illness Mental illness That is the point. In eliminating the nervous breakdown, psychiatry has come close to having its own nervous breakdown. Nerves stand at the core of common mental illness, no matter how much we try to forget them. \"Nervous breakdown\" is a pseudo-medical term to describe a wealth of stress-related feelings and they are often made worse by the belief that there is a real phenomenon called \"nervous breakdown\". There are currently two widely established systems that classify mental disorders: Both of these list categories of disorder and provide standardized criteria for diagnosis. They have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain. Other classification schemes may be used in non-western cultures, for example, the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders, and other manuals may be used by those of alternative theoretical persuasions, such as the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual Mental illness Mental illness",

    "I've tried deep breathing exercises, but they don't seem to help much.",
    "Deep breathing exercises are a good start. You might also benefit from engaging in physical activities or practicing mindfulness.",
    "I'll try incorporating physical activities and mindfulness into my routine. Thank you, Medi.",

A spectrum approach may incorporate elements of both. In the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder, one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgments while another proposes that it is or could be entirely objective and scientific. Common hybrid views argue that the concept of mental disorder is objective even if only a 'fuzzy prototype' that can never be precisely defined, or conversely that the concept always involves a mixture of scientific facts and subjective value judgments.
