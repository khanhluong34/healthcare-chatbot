           "The most commonly used medications for migraine treatment are anticonvulsants like topiramate and divalproex/sodium valproate, and beta blockers like propranolol and metoprolol. These medications have been found to be effective in preventing migraines.",
           "Are there any other medications that can be used?",
           "Yes, there are other medications that have been shown to be effective in migraine prevention. Calcium channel blockers like verapamil and angiotensin receptor blockers like candesartan have proven to be efficient. There is also tentative evidence supporting the use of magnesium supplementation.",

           "The recommendations regarding the effectiveness of gabapentin and pregabalin for migraine prevention vary. While they have shown some benefits, the evidence is not as strong as for other medications. It's best to consult with your doctor to determine the most suitable treatment for you.",

"knowledge": "Migraine Migraine Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating the anticonvulsants topiramate and divalproex/sodium valproate, and the beta blockers propranolol and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence for first-line use for migraine prophylaxis in adults. Propranolol and topiramate have the best evidence in children; however, evidence only supports short-term benefit as of 2020. The beta blocker timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity. While beta blockers are often used for first-line treatment, other antihypertensives also have a proven efficiency in migraine prevention, namely the calcium channel blocker verapamil and the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan. Tentative evidence also supports the use of magnesium supplementation. Increasing dietary intake may be better.
