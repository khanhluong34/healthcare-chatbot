It is typically performed as a screening test for colon cancer in individuals over the age of 50, or earlier if there is a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors.  During the procedure, a long, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into the rectum and advanced through the colon.  Any polyps or abnormal tissue found during the procedure can be removed or biopsied.  The procedure itself usually takes less than an hour, and most people can return to their normal activities within a day. Colonoscopy Colonoscopy",
