These pandemics, in contrast to seasonal influenza, are caused by antigenic shifts involving animal influenza viruses.  To date, all known flu pandemics have been caused by IAVs, and they follow the same pattern of spreading from an origin point to the rest of the world over the course of multiple waves in a year.  Pandemic strains tend to be associated with higher rates of pneumonia in otherwise healthy individuals.  Generally after each influenza pandemic, the pandemic strain continues to circulate as the cause of seasonal influenza, replacing prior strains.  From 1700 to 1889, influenza pandemics occurred about once every 50\u201360 years.  Since then, pandemics have occurred about once every 10\u201350 years, so they may be getting more frequent over time Influenza Influenza",
        "response": "The difference between a pandemic and seasonal influenza is that a pandemic is caused by a new strain of the virus that humans have no pre-existing immunity to, making it more severe and widespread than seasonal influenza. Seasonal influenza is caused by strains of the virus that have been circulating for years and for which humans have developed some immunity."
