The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight, like the Herrerasaurus specimen. A 2006 Space Shuttle experiment found that Salmonella typhimurium, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning, became more virulent when cultivated in space.  On April 29, 2013, scientists in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, funded by NASA, reported that, during spaceflight on the International Space Station, microbes seem to adapt to the space environment in ways 'not observed on Earth' and in ways that 'can lead to increases in growth and virulence'.
