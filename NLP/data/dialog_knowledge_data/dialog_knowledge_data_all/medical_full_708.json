        "knowledge": "Meningitis Meningitis  Sub-Saharan Africa has been plagued by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis for over a century, leading to it being labeled the 'meningitis belt'.  Epidemics typically occur in the dry season, and an epidemic wave can last two to three years, dying out during the intervening rainy seasons.  Attack rates of 100\u2013800 cases per 100,000 are encountered in this area, which is poorly served by medical care.  These cases are predominantly caused by meningococci.  The largest epidemic ever recorded in history swept across the entire region in 1996\u20131997, causing over 250,000 cases and 25,000 deaths. Meningococcal disease occurs in epidemics in areas where many people live together for the first time, such as army barracks during mobilization, university and college campuses and the annual Hajj pilgrimage.  Although the pattern of epidemic cycles in Africa is not well understood, several factors have been associated with the development of epidemics in the meningitis belt Meningitis Meningitis",

            "Hi Medi, I recently had meningitis. What kind of lifestyle changes do I need to make?",
            "I'm sorry to hear that. It's important to take care of yourself after an illness like meningitis. You should get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet, and avoid stressful situations.",
            "Are there any specific foods I should eat?",
            "Foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals can be helpful in boosting your immune system, which can help you recover from meningitis. Some examples include fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains.",
            "What about physical activity?",
            "It's important to stay active, but you should avoid strenuous exercise until your doctor gives you the okay. Walking or light stretching can be a good way to stay active without overexerting yourself.",
            "Thanks for the advice, Medi. I'll make sure to take care of myself.",
