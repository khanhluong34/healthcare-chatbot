A diet high in trans fatty acids is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease, and in 2015 the Food and Drug Administration  determined that there was 'no longer a consensus among qualified experts that partially hydrogenated oils , which are the primary dietary source of industrially produced trans fatty acids , are generally recognized as safe  for any use in human food'.
