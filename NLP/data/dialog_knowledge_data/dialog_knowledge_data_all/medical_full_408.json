In regions where infection rates are 8% or higher, which are classified as high prevalence, vertical transmission is most common. In moderate prevalence areas where 2\u20137% of the population is chronically infected, the disease is predominantly spread horizontally, often among children, or vertically.",

China has a moderate prevalence with an infection rate of 6.89% as of 2019. India also has a moderate prevalence, with studies placing its infection rate between 2-4%.",
