But a minority of cancer types rely on oxidative phosphorylation as the primary energy source, including lymphoma, leukemia, and endometrial cancer.  Even in these cases, however, the use of glycolysis as an energy source rarely exceeds 60%.  A few cancers use glutamine as the major energy source, partly because it provides nitrogen required for nucleotide  synthesis.  Cancer stem cells often use oxidative phosphorylation or glutamine as a primary energy source. Several studies have indicated that the enzyme sirtuin 6 is selectively inactivated during oncogenesis in a variety of tumor types by inducing glycolysis.  Another sirtuin, sirtuin 3 inhibits cancers that depend upon glycolysis, but promotes cancers that depend upon oxidative phosphorylation Cancer Cancer",

    "dialog": ["Hi, Medi. I'm curious about cancer names. Can you tell me more about them?",
               "Sure, I'd be happy to. Cancer names can be based on a number of factors, such as the organ or tissue where the cancer starts, the appearance of the cancer cells under a microscope, or the size and shape of the cancer cells.",
               "That's interesting. Can you give me some examples?",
               "Sure. Breast cancer is named based on the cells that line the milk ducts, so the most common type of breast cancer is called ductal carcinoma. Benign tumors are named using -oma as a suffix with the organ name as the root. For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a leiomyoma. Some types of cancer use the -noma suffix, such as melanoma and seminoma. Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, and small-cell carcinoma.",

               "Cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease cancer risk. This can include things like eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, and protecting your skin from the sun.",

    "knowledge": "Chemotherapy Chemotherapy  Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells.  It works by stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells, which grow and divide quickly.  However, it also affects normal cells that divide quickly, such as the cells in the mouth, stomach, and hair.  There are various side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, anemia, infections, and bleeding or bruising.  Patients receiving chemotherapy should eat a healthy diet that focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein, and avoid processed foods and sugary snacks.  Light exercise, such as walking or yoga, can help improve energy levels, and patients should avoid anything too strenuous or exhausting.  Patients should also avoid contact with sick people and practice good hand hygiene Chemotherapy Chemotherapy",
