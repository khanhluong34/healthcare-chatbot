Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly-inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.   In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.  Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, a lack of physical exercise, alcoholism, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, and a family history of breast cancer. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. Breast cancer diagnosis depends on a pathologic examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen of the suspicious area. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, treatment options are chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. Breast cancer Breast cancer",
