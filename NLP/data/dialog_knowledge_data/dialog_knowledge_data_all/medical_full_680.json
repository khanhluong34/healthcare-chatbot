        "knowledge": "Mollaret's Meningitis Mollaret's meningitis is a chronic recurrent form of herpes meningitis. It is thought to be caused by herpes simplex virus type 2. The symptoms of Mollaret's meningitis are similar to those of other types of meningitis, including fever, headache, and stiff neck. In some cases, there may be a rash or lesions on the skin or mucous membranes. Mollaret's meningitis is infectious and can be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, such as saliva or genital secretions, during periods of viral shedding. The diagnosis of Mollaret's meningitis is made based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI. A lumbar puncture may also be done to examine the cerebrospinal fluid for signs of infection. There is no cure for Mollaret's meningitis, but antiviral medications can be used to suppress the herpes virus and reduce the frequency and severity of recurrent episodes.",
