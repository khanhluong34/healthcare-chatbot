Hernias come in a number of types.  Most commonly they involve the abdomen, specifically the groin.  The risk of developing a hernia is greater in people who are overweight or who have a family history of hernias.  Treatment is typically surgery.  The use of a mesh to improve outcomes is controversial, with some studies finding that it reduces the risk of recurrence, while others suggest it may not be effective.  It is estimated that up to 27% of males and 3% of females develop a groin hernia at some time in their life Hernia Hernia",
