Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are both autosomal recessive diseases involving abnormal storage of minerals.  In hemochromatosis, excess amounts of iron accumulate in multiple body sites, including the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis.  In Wilson's disease, excess amounts of copper accumulate in the liver and brain, causing cirrhosis and dementia.

Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are both autosomal recessive diseases involving abnormal storage of minerals. In hemochromatosis, excess amounts of iron accumulate in multiple body sites, including the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis. In Wilson's disease, excess amounts of copper accumulate in the liver and brain, causing cirrhosis and dementia.",
