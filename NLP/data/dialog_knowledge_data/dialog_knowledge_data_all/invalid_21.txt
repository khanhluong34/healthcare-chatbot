"knowledge": "Migraine Migraine Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating the anticonvulsants topiramate and divalproex/sodium valproate, and the beta blockers propranolol and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence for first-line use for migraine prophylaxis in adults. Propranolol and topiramate have the best evidence in children; however, evidence only supports short-term benefit as of 2020. The beta blocker timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity. While beta blockers are often used for first-line treatment, other antihypertensives also have a proven efficiency in migraine prevention, namely the calcium channel blocker verapamil and the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan. Tentative evidence also supports the use of magnesium supplementation. Increasing dietary intake may be better.

"knowledge": "Obesity Obesity The correlation between social class and BMI varies globally.  Research in 1989 found that in developed countries women of a high social class were less likely to be obese.  No significant differences were seen among men of different social classes.  In the developing world, women, men, and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity.  In 2007 repeating the same research found the same relationships, but they were weaker.  The decrease in strength of correlation was felt to be due to the effects of globalization.  Among developed countries, levels of adult obesity, and percentage of teenage children who are overweight, are correlated with income inequality Obesity Obesity",

"knowledge": "Obesity Obesity Obesity is a complex public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects.  As such, managing it requires changes in the wider societal context and effort by communities, local authorities, and governments.  Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population.  Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity.  Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools.  The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks.

           "Thank you for your advice. How can I manage my weight effectively?"],
"knowledge": "Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism  Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, occurs when the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, sluggishness, and difficulty concentrating. Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed through a blood test to check hormone levels. Treatment typically involves medication to restore thyroid hormone levels. Lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, can also help manage weight in individuals with hypothyroidism.",

"knowledge": "Obesity Obesity  Obesity is influenced by various factors. In addition to social class, other factors such as genetics, lifestyle choices, and cultural values can contribute to obesity. There is evidence of a correlation in BMI changes over time among friends, siblings, and spouses, suggesting social influence. Additionally, stress and perceived low social status are associated with an increased risk of obesity.",
