Aura is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache. Aura appears gradually over a number of minutes and generally lasts less than 60 minutes.

These changes may include consuming smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding high-fat foods, and gradually reintroducing fats into the diet. Physical activity should be resumed gradually, with avoidance of heavy lifting or strenuous exercises for a few weeks. Recovery time varies, but most people can resume normal activities within a week and experience a full recovery within a few weeks.

  "knowledge": "Obesity Obesity Obesity is a complex public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. As such, managing it requires changes in the wider societal context and effort by communities, local authorities, and governments. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts have been made to increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes Obesity Obesity",
