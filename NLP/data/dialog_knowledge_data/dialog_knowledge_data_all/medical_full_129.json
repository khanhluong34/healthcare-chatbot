        "knowledge": "Mesothelioma Mesothelioma Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs, the mesothelium.  The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall.  Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected.  The primary cause of mesothelioma is exposure to asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral that is used in a variety of industrial applications.  Symptoms of mesothelioma include coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.  The prognosis for mesothelioma is poor, with most patients surviving less than a year after diagnosis.",
        "response": "Mesothelioma is a type of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, and it affects the lining of the lungs and other organs. The best way to prevent mesothelioma is to avoid exposure to asbestos. If you work in an industry where asbestos is used, make sure to follow safety protocols and wear protective gear."

Risk factors include other lung diseases such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke and a weak immune system.  Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination.  Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. Pneumonia Pneumonia",

It often starts as a flat, brown or black mole that gradually grows in size and can become ulcerated or bleed. Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common types of skin cancer, and include basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. They usually develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Tanning beds and lamps also contribute to the development of skin cancer. Skin cancer can be treated by surgical removal of the affected area, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy.",
