            "Certainly. To diagnose Hepatitis C, a positive test is followed by a confirmatory test. The immunoassay is verified using a recombinant immunoblot assay. The viral load is determined through an HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction. If there is no RNA but the immunoblot is positive, it means the person had a previous infection that cleared, either with treatment or spontaneously. If the immunoblot is negative, it means the immunoassay was wrong. It usually takes 6-8 weeks after infection for the immunoassay to test positive. Point-of-care testing is also available for quicker results.",
