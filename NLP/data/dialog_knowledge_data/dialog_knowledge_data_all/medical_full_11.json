It is a symptom of coronary artery disease, which occurs when the blood vessels that supply the heart become narrow or blocked.  Angina is usually described as a pressure or squeezing sensation in the chest that may spread to the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder or back.  It may also be accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or dizziness.  Treatment for angina includes lifestyle changes, medications and procedures such as angioplasty or bypass surgery.
