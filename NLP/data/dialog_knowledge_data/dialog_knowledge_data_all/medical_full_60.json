It is commonly used to screen for colon cancer and screen for and remove polyps (precancerous growths) from the colon.  During a colonoscopy, a flexible tube with a camera on the end is inserted into the rectum and guided through the colon.  Patients are typically given a sedative or anesthesia to help them relax during the procedure.   After the procedure, patients are monitored for a short time before being discharged.  Some mild side effects, such as cramping, bloating, or gas, are common.  Serious side effects, such as bleeding, perforation of the colon, or infection, are rare but possible.  Patients should contact their doctor right away if they experience severe pain, bleeding, or fever.",
