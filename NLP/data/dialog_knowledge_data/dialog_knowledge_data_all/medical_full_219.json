Most of this pressure is due to the work done by the heart in pumping blood through the circulatory system. The systolic pressure is defined as the peak pressure in the arteries, which occurs when the ventricles are contracting. The diastolic pressure is defined as the lowest pressure in the arteries, which occurs when the ventricles are relaxed. In the United States, about 1 in 3 adults have high blood pressure.  High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, but can cause serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, heart attack, and kidney failure.
