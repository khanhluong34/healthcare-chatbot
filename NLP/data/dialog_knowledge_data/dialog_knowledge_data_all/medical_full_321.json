It can help diagnose liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and determine the extent of liver damage.  The procedure involves inserting a needle through the skin and into the liver to remove a small piece of tissue. A local anesthetic is used to minimize any discomfort.  After the biopsy, you may need to rest for a few hours to avoid bleeding.  The risks include bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding organs.
