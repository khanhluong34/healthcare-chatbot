In addition, some medications can cause jaundice as a side effect.  Mild jaundice usually goes away on its own.  Treatment of more severe jaundice depends on the cause.  For example, hepatitis A usually resolves on its own, while hepatitis B and C may require antiviral medications.  Obstruction of the bile duct may require surgery. Jaundice Jaundice",
