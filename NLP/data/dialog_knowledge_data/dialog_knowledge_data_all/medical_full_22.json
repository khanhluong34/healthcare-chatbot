Transesophageal atrial stimulation  instead uses an electrode inserted through the esophagus to a part where the distance to the posterior wall of the left atrium is only approximately 5\u20136 mm .  Transesophageal atrial stimulation can differentiate between atrial flutter, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia.  It can also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome, as well as terminate supraventricular tachycardia caused by re-entry. Each heartbeat originates as an electrical impulse from a small area of tissue in the right atrium of the heart called the sinus node or sinoatrial node .  The impulse initially causes both atria to contract, then activates the atrioventricular node , which is normally the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles .   The impulse then spreads through both ventricles via the bundle of His and the Purkinje fibers causing a synchronized contraction of the heart muscle and, thus, the pulse Arrhythmia Arrhythmia",
