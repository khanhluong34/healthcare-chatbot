        "knowledge": "Pain Pain  Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli.  Pain can be classified as acute or chronic.  Acute pain is often caused by injury or disease and is usually a warning sign for tissue damage.  Chronic pain, on the other hand, is pain that persists beyond the usual course of an acute disease or injury or beyond a reasonable time for the body to heal.  Chronic pain can be caused by many factors and can lead to disability and depression.  Pain can be treated with medications, physical therapy, and other interventions.  Mild-to-moderate pain can be treated with non-opioid pain relievers such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen. Pain Pain",
