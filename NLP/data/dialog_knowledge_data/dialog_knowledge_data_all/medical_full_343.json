            "The treatment options depend on the severity and type of Hepatitis. Acute Hepatitis usually doesn't require treatment, but in some cases, antiviral medications can be used. In chronic Hepatitis, antiviral medications are often used to help control the disease and prevent further liver damage.",

In these rare, more severe acute cases, patients have been successfully treated with antiviral therapy similar to that used in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or tenofovir. As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.

Seven drugs are approved in the United States: First-line treatments currently used include PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir, subject to patient and physician preference.",

Certain patients warrant hospitalization, especially those who present with clinical signs of ascites, peripheral edema, and hepatic encephalopathy, and laboratory signs of hypoglycemia, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin, and very high serum bilirubin. In these rare, more severe acute cases, patients have been successfully treated with antiviral therapy similar to that used in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or tenofovir.  As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.
