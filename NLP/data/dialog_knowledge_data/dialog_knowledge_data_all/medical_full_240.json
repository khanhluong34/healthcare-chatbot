Symptoms of appendicitis include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. If left untreated, the appendix can burst, causing a serious infection in the abdomen. An appendectomy is a common and safe procedure. However, like any surgery, there are risks of complications such as bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding organs.",
