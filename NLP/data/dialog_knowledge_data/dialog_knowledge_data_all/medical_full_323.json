Typically, the headaches affect one half of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to 3 days. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity. Up to one-third of people have an aura: typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur. Occasionally, an aura can occur with little or no headache following it. Migraines are believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors. A number of psychological conditions are associated with migraines, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Migraines occur more commonly in women than men, with a prevalence of about 18% and 6% respectively. Migraines Migraine",
