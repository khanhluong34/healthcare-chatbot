With the onset of the Industrial Revolution it was realized that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers.  Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range played a significant role in the development of industrialized societies.

Corpulence is, however, absent in both Greek and Roman art, probably in keeping with their ideals regarding moderation. This continued through much of Christian European history, with only those of low socioeconomic status being depicted as obese.

  "knowledge": "Obesity Obesity  In 1998, the first US Federal guidelines were published, titled 'Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults: The Evidence Report'. In 2006, the Canadian Obesity Network, now known as Obesity Canada, published the 'Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management and Prevention of Obesity in Adults and Children'. This is a comprehensive evidence-based guideline to address the management and prevention of overweight and obesity in adults and children. In 2004, the United Kingdom Royal College of Physicians, the Faculty of Public Health and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health released the report 'Storing up Problems', which highlighted the growing problem of obesity in the UK. The same year, the House of Commons Health Select Committee published its 'most comprehensive inquiry ever undertaken' into the impact of obesity on health and society in the UK and possible approaches to the problem. In 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence issued a guideline on the diagnosis and management of obesity, as well as policy implications for non-healthcare organizations such as local councils. A 2007 report produced by Derek Wanless for the King's Fund warned that unless further action was taken, obesity had the capacity to debilitate the National Health Service financially Obesity Obesity",
