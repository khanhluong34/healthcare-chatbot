        "knowledge": "Hepatitis Hepatitis  While the risk of progression to chronic infection is approximately 5% among adults who contract the virus, it is as high as 95% among neonates subject to vertical transmission.  The risk of viral transmission is approximately 10\u201320% when maternal blood is positive for HBsAg, and up to 90% when also positive for HBeAg. Given the high risk of perinatal transmission, the CDC recommends screening all pregnant women for HBV at their first prenatal visit.  It is safe for non-immune pregnant women to receive the HBV vaccine.  Based on the limited available evidence, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases  recommends antiviral therapy in pregnant women whose viral load exceeds 200,000 IU/mL.  A growing body of evidence shows that antiviral therapy initiated in the third trimester significantly reduces transmission to the neonate.  A systematic review of the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry database found that there was no increased risk of congenital anomalies with Tenofovir; for this reason, along with its potency and low risk of resistance, the AASLD recommends this drug Hepatitis Hepatitis",
