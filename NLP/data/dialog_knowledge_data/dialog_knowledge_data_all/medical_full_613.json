            "Okay, thank you. Can you tell me more about the flu season?",
            "The flu season is the time of year when the flu virus is most active and spreads easily from person to person. It typically starts in the fall and continues through the winter months, peaking in January or February. During this time, it's especially important to practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, to prevent the spread of the virus.",
            "I see. How can I tell if I have the flu?",
