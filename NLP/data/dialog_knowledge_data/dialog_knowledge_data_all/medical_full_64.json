They can include certain foods, pollen, or pet dander, among other things. When you come into contact with an allergen, your body releases histamine, which can cause symptoms like itching, sneezing, and coughing. Allergies can be managed with medication or by avoiding triggers. Allergy shots are another option that can reduce the severity of reactions over time. Allergies Allergies",
