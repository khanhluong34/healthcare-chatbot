The backwash of acid irritates the lining of your esophagus and causes GERD signs and symptoms. Symptoms of GERD include heartburn, regurgitation, and nausea.  Lifestyle changes can help control the symptoms of GERD.  These include avoiding foods that trigger symptoms, eating smaller meals, not lying down for at least 2 to 3 hours after eating, losing weight, and avoiding smoking.
