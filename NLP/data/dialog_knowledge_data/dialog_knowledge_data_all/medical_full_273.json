Glucose is vital to your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues. It's also your brain's main source of fuel. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin. Diabetes can cause serious complications such as blindness, kidney failure, and heart disease. However, with proper management, people with diabetes can live long and healthy lives.",
