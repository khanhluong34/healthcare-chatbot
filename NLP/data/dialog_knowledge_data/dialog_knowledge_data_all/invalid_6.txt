A few people may have a more severe form of liver disease known as fulminant hepatic failure and may die as a result.  The infection may be entirely asymptomatic and may go unrecognized. Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus may be asymptomatic or may be associated with chronic inflammation of the liver , leading to cirrhosis over a period of several years.  This type of infection dramatically increases the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma .  Across Europe, hepatitis B and C cause approximately 50% of hepatocellular carcinomas.  Chronic carriers are encouraged to avoid consuming alcohol as it increases their risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer Hepatitis B Hepatitis B",

Early life horizontal transmission can occur through bites, lesions, certain sanitary habits, or other contact with secretions or saliva containing HBV.  Adult horizontal transmission is known to occur through sexual contact, blood transfusions and transfusion with other human blood products, re-use of contaminated needles and syringes.  Breastfeeding after proper immunoprophylaxis does not appear to contribute to mother-to-child-transmission  of HBV. Hepatitis B virus  is a member of the hepadnavirus family.

The virus persists in the liver, becoming chronic, in about 70% of those initially infected. Early on, chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis.

Diagnosing patients is generally a challenge as patients with acute illness generally present with mild, non-specific flu-like symptoms, while the transition from acute to chronic is sub-clinical. Chronic hepatitis C is defined as infection with the hepatitis C virus persisting for more than six months based on the presence of its RNA. Chronic infections are typically asymptomatic during the first few decades, and thus are most commonly discovered following the investigation of elevated liver enzyme levels or during a routine screening of high-risk individuals. Testing is not able to distinguish between acute and chronic infections. Diagnosis in infants is difficult as maternal antibodies may persist for up to 18 months. Hepatitis C testing typically begins with blood testing to detect the presence of antibodies to the HCV, using an enzyme immunoassay Hepatitis C Hepatitis C",
