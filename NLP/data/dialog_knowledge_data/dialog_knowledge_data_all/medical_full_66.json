They can occur in any part of the airway, from the trachea to the bronchioles.  The symptoms depend on the type of mass, but they may include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pain.  Treatment options depend on the type of mass and may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.  Early detection is key to preventing complications and improving outcomes.  Tests used to detect airway masses include bronchoscopy, CT scans, MRI scans, and PET scans.
