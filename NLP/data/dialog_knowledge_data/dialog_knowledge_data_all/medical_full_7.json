This may cause a single premature beat now and then, or, if the ectopic focus fires more often than the sinoatrial node, it can produce a sustained abnormal rhythm.  Rhythms produced by an ectopic focus in the atria, or by the atrioventricular node, are the least dangerous dysrhythmias; but they can still produce a decrease in the heart's pumping efficiency because the signal reaches the various parts of the heart muscle with different timing than usual and can be responsible for poorly coordinated contraction. Conditions that increase automaticity include sympathetic nervous system stimulation and hypoxia.  The resulting heart rhythm depends on where the first signal begins: If it is the sinoatrial node, the rhythm remains normal but rapid; if it is an ectopic focus, many types of dysrhythmia may ensue. Re-entrant arrhythmias occur when an electrical impulse recurrently travels in a tight circle within the heart, rather than moving from one end of the heart to the other and then stopping.

        "knowledge": "Arrhythmia Arrhythmia Any part of the heart that initiates an impulse without waiting for the sinoatrial node is called an ectopic focus and is, by definition, a pathological phenomenon.  This may cause a single premature beat now and then, or, if the ectopic focus fires more often than the sinoatrial node, it can produce a sustained abnormal rhythm.  Rhythms produced by an ectopic focus in the atria, or by the atrioventricular node, are the least dangerous dysrhythmias; but they can still produce a decrease in the heart's pumping efficiency because the signal reaches the various parts of the heart muscle with different timing than usual and can be responsible for poorly coordinated contraction. Conditions that increase automaticity include sympathetic nervous system stimulation and hypoxia.  The resulting heart rhythm depends on where the first signal begins: If it is the sinoatrial node, the rhythm remains normal but rapid; if it is an ectopic focus, many types of dysrhythmia may ensue. Re-entrant arrhythmias occur when an electrical impulse recurrently travels in a tight circle within the heart, rather than moving from one end of the heart to the other and then stopping. Every cardiac cell can transmit impulses of excitation in every direction but will do so only once within a short time Arrhythmia Arrhythmia",
        "response": "It depends on the severity of your condition. Some types of arrhythmia can be cured, while others can be managed with treatment."

            "What about my diet? Should I avoid certain foods?",
            "You should avoid foods that are high in cholesterol or saturated fat. Instead, focus on a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.",

            "You should avoid exercising for a few days after the procedure and then gradually resume your normal physical activities as recommended by your doctor.",

        "knowledge": "Cardiac catheterization Cardiac catheterization Cardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat certain heart conditions. During the procedure, a thin tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in your arm, groin, or neck and threaded to your heart.  The procedure can be used to diagnose heart problems like coronary artery disease, heart valve problems, or heart defects.  It can also be used to treat heart conditions like blocked arteries by opening them with a balloon or stent.  Recovery time depends on the type of procedure done, but typically it takes a few days to resume normal activities after a diagnostic procedure and up to a week after a more complex procedure.
