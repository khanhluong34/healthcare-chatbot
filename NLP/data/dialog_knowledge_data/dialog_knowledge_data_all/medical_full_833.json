Negative impacts also frequently occur for a person's family. Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows promise, as does transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation. There is preliminary evidence that a ketogenic diet may help prevent episodic and long-term migraine. While no definitive proof has been found linking migraine to gender, statistical data indicates that women may be more prone to having migraines, showing migraine incidence three times higher among women than men Migraine Migraine",
