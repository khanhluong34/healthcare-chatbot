Other possible contributors to the recent increase of obesity are: insufficient sleep, endocrine disruptors, decreased variability in ambient temperature, decreased rates of smoking, increased use of medications that can cause weight gain, proportional increases in ethnic and age groups that tend to be heavier, pregnancy at a later age, epigenetic risk factors passed on generationally, natural selection for higher BMI, and assortative mating leading to increased concentration of obesity risk factors. According to the Endocrine Society, there is \"growing evidence suggesting that obesity is a disorder of the energy homeostasis system, rather than simply arising from the passive accumulation of excess weight\". Societal pressure to diet as a means of maintaining or losing weight has also been suggested as a possible contributor. Excess appetite for palatable, high-calorie food is seen as the primary factor driving obesity worldwide, likely because of imbalances in neurotransmitters affecting the drive to eat.
