With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many individuals can lead a better quality of life than if going undiagnosed for long after RA's onset.  The risk factors with the strongest association for developing rheumatoid arthritis are the female sex, a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, age, obesity, previous joint damage from an injury, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis.  Bone continuously undergoes remodeling by actions of bone resorbing osteoclasts and bone forming osteoblasts.  One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand , a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts.
