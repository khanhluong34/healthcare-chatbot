During the procedure, a catheter is guided to the heart through a vein in the groin or neck.  Radiofrequency energy or extreme cold is used to destroy small areas of heart tissue that are causing the irregular heartbeat.  The procedure is generally safe and effective, although there is a risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, or damage to blood vessels or nerves.  Recovery time may vary depending on the patient and the specific procedure performed Cardiac Ablation Cardiac Ablation",
