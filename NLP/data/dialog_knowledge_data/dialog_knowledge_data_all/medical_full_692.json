For some causes of meningitis, protection can be provided in the long term through vaccination, or in the short term with antibiotics.  Some behavioral measures may also be effective. Bacterial and viral meningitis are contagious, but neither is as contagious as the common cold or flu.  Both can be transmitted through droplets of respiratory secretions during close contact such as kissing, sneezing or coughing on someone, but bacterial meningitis cannot be spread by only breathing the air where a person with meningitis has been.  Viral meningitis is typically caused by enteroviruses, and is most commonly spread through fecal contamination Meningitis Meningitis",
