        "knowledge": "Obesity Obesity They estimate the global cost of obesity $2 trillion a year, about or 2.8% of world GDP. Obesity prevention programs have been found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public's health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending. Sin taxes such as a sugary drink tax have been implemented in certain countries globally to curb dietary and consumer habits, and as an effort to offset the economic tolls. Obesity can lead to social stigmatization and disadvantages in employment Obesity Obesity",
        "response": "Obesity prevention programs have been effective in reducing the cost of treating obesity-related diseases. However, reducing obesity is unlikely to significantly reduce overall health spending. Some countries have implemented sin taxes, like a sugary drink tax, to address dietary habits and offset the economic impact of obesity."

        "knowledge": "Obesity Obesity Obesity is a complex public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. As such, managing it requires changes in the wider societal context and effort by communities, local authorities, and governments. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts have been made to increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes Obesity Obesity",
