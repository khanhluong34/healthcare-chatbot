      "Sure! The other primary headache disorders include tension-type headaches and cluster headaches. Tension-type headaches are usually described as a dull, non-pulsating pain and can last from minutes to days. Cluster headaches are severe headaches that occur in cyclical patterns, often accompanied by eye watering, nasal congestion, and restlessness.",

    "knowledge": "Migraine Migraine The diagnosis of migraine without aura, according to the International Headache Society, can be made according to the following criteria, the '5, 4, 3, 2, 1 criteria': If someone experiences two of the following: photophobia, nausea, or inability to work or study for a day, the diagnosis is more likely. In those with four out of five of the following: pulsating headache, duration of 4–72 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person's life, the probability that this is a migraine attack is 92%. In those with fewer than three of these symptoms, the probability is 17%. Migraine was first comprehensively classified in 1988. The International Headache Society updated their classification of headaches in 2004. A third version was published in 2018. According to this classification, migraine is a primary headache disorder along with tension-type headaches and cluster headaches, among others Migraine Migraine",

      "Hi Medi, I've been experiencing aura, nausea, and photophobia lately.",
      "Those symptoms could be associated with acephalgic migraine, a variant of migraine without headache.",
      "Is it common? I've never heard of it before.",
      "Acephalgic migraine is relatively uncommon, but it can occur in some individuals who experience migraine symptoms without the typical headache.",
      "I see. Are there any other types of migraine?",
      "Yes, there are several subclasses of migraine, including scintillating scotoma or visual migraine, retinal migraine, and abdominal migraine.",
      "What are the main differences between them?",
      "Scintillating scotoma or visual migraine is a visual disturbance that may precede a migraine headache, while retinal migraine involves visual disturbances in one eye only. Abdominal migraine is characterized by recurrent episodes of abdominal pain without a headache.",
      "That's interesting. Can abdominal migraine be a precursor to migraines?",
      "Yes, there is some evidence suggesting that recurrent episodes of abdominal pain without headache may be a type of migraine or a precursor to migraines.",

Scintillating scotoma or visual migraine is distinct from retinal migraine. It is a visual disturbance originating from the brain that may precede a migraine headache but can also occur acephalgically. The diagnosis of abdominal migraine is controversial. Some evidence indicates that recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the absence of a headache may be a type of migraine or are at least a precursor to migraines. These episodes of pain may or may not follow a migraine-like prodrome and typically last minutes to hours. They often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical migraine.
