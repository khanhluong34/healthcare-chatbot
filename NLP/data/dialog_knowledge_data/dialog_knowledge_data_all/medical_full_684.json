When components of the bacterial cell membrane are identified by the immune cells of the brain , they respond by releasing large amounts of cytokines, hormone-like mediators that recruit other immune cells and stimulate other tissues to participate in an immune response.  The blood\u2013brain barrier becomes more permeable, leading to 'vasogenic' cerebral edema .  Large numbers of white blood cells enter the CSF, causing inflammation of the meninges and leading to 'interstitial' edema .  In addition, the walls of the blood vessels themselves become inflamed , which leads to decreased blood flow and a third type of edema, 'cytotoxic' edema.  The three forms of cerebral edema all lead to increased intracranial pressure; together with the lowered blood pressure often encountered in sepsis, this means that it is harder for blood to enter the brain; consequently brain cells are deprived of oxygen and undergo apoptosis .
