Kernig's sign is assessed with the person lying supine, with the hip and knee flexed to 90\u00a0degrees.  In a person with a positive Kernig's sign, pain limits passive extension of the knee.  A positive Brudzinski's sign occurs when flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip.  Although Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign are both commonly used to screen for meningitis, the sensitivity of these tests is limited.  They do, however, have very good specificity for meningitis: the signs rarely occur in other diseases.  Another test, known as the 'jolt accentuation maneuver' helps determine whether meningitis is present in those reporting fever and headache Meningitis Meningitis",
        "response": "Treatment depends on the type of meningitis. Bacterial meningitis requires antibiotics, while viral meningitis may resolve on its own with supportive care."
