The process appears to set off a wound-healing reaction, and when people use cannabis, the cannabinoids bind to these receptors in the same way. Previous studies have shown that CB1 receptors located on the nerve cells in the gut respond to cannabinoids by slowing gut motility, therefore reducing the painful muscle contractions associated with diarrhea.

Symptoms include blood in the stool, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, weight loss, and fatigue.  Colon cancer screening is recommended for all adults starting at age 45.  Screening is usually done with a colonoscopy, which can detect precancerous polyps before they turn into cancer.  Treatment depends on the stage of the cancer, but may involve surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
