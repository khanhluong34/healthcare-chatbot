Hepatitis Hepatitis  SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure.  Currently available treatments include indirect and direct acting antiviral drugs.  The indirect acting antivirals include pegylated interferon  and ribavirin , which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV.  Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype.  These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas.  In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes:These drugs are used in various combinations, sometimes combined with ribavirin, based on the patient's genotype, delineated as genotypes 1â€“6.  Genotype 1 , which is the most prevalent genotype in the United States and around the world, can now be cured with a direct acting antiviral regimen Hepatitis Hepatitis
