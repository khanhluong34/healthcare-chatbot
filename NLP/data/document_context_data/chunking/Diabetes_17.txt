Yet another form of diabetes that people may develop is double diabetes.  This is when a type 1 diabetic becomes insulin resistant, the hallmark for type 2 diabetes or has a family history for type 2 diabetes.  It was first discovered in 1990 or 1991. The following is a list of disorders that may increase the risk of diabetes:Insulin is the principal hormone that regulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into most cells of the body, especially liver, adipose tissue and muscle, except smooth muscle, in which insulin acts via the IGF-1.  Therefore, deficiency of insulin or the insensitivity of its receptors play a central role in all forms of diabetes mellitus. The body obtains glucose from three main sources: the intestinal absorption of food; the breakdown of glycogen , the storage form of glucose found in the liver; and gluconeogenesis, the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates in the body.  Insulin plays a critical role in regulating glucose levels in the body Diabetes Diabetes
