Hepatitis B Hepatitis B The virus is divided into four major serotypes  based on antigenic epitopes presented on its envelope proteins, and into eight major genotypes .  The genotypes have a distinct geographical distribution and are used in tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus.  Differences between genotypes affect the disease severity, course and likelihood of complications, and response to treatment and possibly vaccination.  There are two other genotypes I and J but they are not universally accepted as of 2015.  The diversity of genotypes is not shown equally in the world.  For example, A, D, and E genotypes have been seen in Africa prevalently while B and C genotypes are observed in Asia as widespread. Genotypes differ by at least 8% of their sequence and were first reported in 1988 when six were initially described  Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
