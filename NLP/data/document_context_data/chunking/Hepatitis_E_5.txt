Hepatitis E Hepatitis E Hepatitis E  is endemic and can cause outbreaks in Southeast Asia, northern and central Africa, India, and Central America.  It is spread mainly by the fecal–oral route due to contamination of water supplies or food; direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon.  In contrast to genotypes 1 and 2, genotypes 3 and 4 cause sporadic cases thought to be contracted zoonotically, from direct contact with animals or indirectly from contaminated water or undercooked meat.
