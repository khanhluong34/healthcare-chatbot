Influenza Influenza If live poultry markets are not closed, then "clean days" when unsold poultry is removed and facilities are disinfected and "no carry-over" policies to eliminate infectious material before new poultry arrive can be used to reduce the spread of influenza viruses.  If a novel influenza viruses has breached the aforementioned biosecurity measures, then rapid detection to stamp it out via quarantining, decontamination, and culling may be necessary to prevent the virus from becoming endemic.  Vaccines exist for avian H5, H7, and H9 subtypes that are used in some countries.  In China, for example, vaccination of domestic birds against H7N9 successfully limited its spread, indicating that vaccination may be an effective strategy if used in combination with other measures to limit transmission.  In pigs and horses, management of influenza is dependent on vaccination with biosecurity. Diagnosis based on symptoms is fairly accurate in otherwise healthy people during seasonal epidemics and should be suspected in cases of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome , sepsis, or if encephalitis, myocarditis, or breaking down of muscle tissue occur.  Because influenza is similar to other viral respiratory tract illnesses, laboratory diagnosis is necessary for confirmation Influenza Influenza
