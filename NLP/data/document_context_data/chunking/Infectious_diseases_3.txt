Infectious diseases Infectious diseases Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body, grows and multiplies.  This is referred to as colonization.  Most humans are not easily infected.  Those with compromised or weakened immune systems have an increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections.  Individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections.  Entrance to the host at host-pathogen interface, generally occurs through the mucosa in orifices like the oral cavity, nose, eyes, genitalia, anus, or the microbe can enter through open wounds.  While a few organisms can grow at the initial site of entry, many migrate and cause systemic infection in different organs Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
