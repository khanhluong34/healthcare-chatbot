Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  The nucleocapsid encloses the viral DNA and a DNA polymerase that has reverse transcriptase activity.  The outer envelope contains embedded proteins that are involved in viral binding of, and entry into, susceptible cells.  The virus is one of the smallest enveloped animal viruses.   The 42Â nm virions, which are capable of infecting liver cells known as hepatocytes, are referred to as "Dane particles".  In addition to the Dane particles, filamentous and spherical bodies lacking a core can be found in the serum of infected individuals.    These particles are not infectious and are composed of the lipid and protein that forms part of the surface of the virion, which is called the surface antigens , and is produced in excess during the life cycle of the virus. The genome of HBV is made of circular DNA, but it is unusual because the DNA is not fully double-stranded Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
