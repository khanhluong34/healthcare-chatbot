Pneumonia Pneumonia  Lung abscesses can usually be seen with a chest X-ray but frequently require a chest CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.  Abscesses typically occur in aspiration pneumonia, and often contain several types of bacteria.  Long-term antibiotics are usually adequate to treat a lung abscess, but sometimes the abscess must be drained by a surgeon or radiologist. Pneumonia can cause respiratory failure by triggering acute respiratory distress syndrome , which results from a combination of infection and inflammatory response.  The lungs quickly fill with fluid and become stiff.  This stiffness, combined with severe difficulties extracting oxygen due to the alveolar fluid, may require long periods of mechanical ventilation for survival.  Other causes of circulatory failure are hypoxemia, inflammation, and increased coagulability Pneumonia Pneumonia
