Hepatitis Hepatitis Non-alcoholic liver disease occurs in people with little or no history of alcohol use, and is instead strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia.  Over time, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which additionally involves liver cell death, liver inflammation and possible fibrosis.  Factors accelerating progression from NAFLD to NASH are obesity, older age, non-African American ethnicity, female gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, higher ALT or AST level, higher AST/ALT ratio, low platelet count, and an ultrasound steatosis score. In the early stages , most patients are asymptomatic or have mild right upper quadrant pain, and diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests.  As the disease progresses, symptoms typical of chronic hepatitis may develop.  While imaging can show fatty liver, only liver biopsy can demonstrate inflammation and fibrosis characteristic of NASH.  9 to 25% of patients with NASH develop cirrhosis Hepatitis Hepatitis
