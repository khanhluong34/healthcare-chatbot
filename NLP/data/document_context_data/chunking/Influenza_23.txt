Influenza Influenza  Interferons mediate expression of antiviral proteins and proteins that recruit immune cells to the infection site, and they also notify nearby uninfected cells of infection.  Some infected cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection.  Immune cells control viral infection by killing infected cells and phagocytizing viral particles and apoptotic cells.  An exacerbated immune response, however, can harm the host organism through a cytokine storm.  To counter the immune response, influenza viruses encode various non-structural proteins, including NS1, NEP, PB1-F2, and PA-X, that are involved in curtailing the host immune response by suppressing interferon production and host gene expression. B cells, a type of white blood cell, produce antibodies that bind to influenza antigens HA and NA  and other proteins to a lesser degree.  Once bound to these proteins, antibodies block virions from binding to cellular receptors, neutralizing the virus Influenza Influenza
