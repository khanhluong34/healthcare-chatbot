Arrhythmia Arrhythmia Arrhythmias are often categorized into four groups: extra beats, supraventricular tachycardias, ventricular arrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias.  Extra beats include premature atrial contractions, premature ventricular contractions and premature junctional contractions.  Supraventricular tachycardias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.  Ventricular arrhythmias include ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.  Bradyarrhythmias are due to sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction disturbances.  Arrhythmias are due to problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart.  A number of tests can help with diagnosis, including an electrocardiogram  and Holter monitor Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
