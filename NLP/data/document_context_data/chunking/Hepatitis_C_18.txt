Hepatitis C Hepatitis C  If this test is positive, a confirmatory test is then performed to verify the immunoassay and to determine the viral load.  A recombinant immunoblot assay is used to verify the immunoassay and the viral load is determined by an HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction.  If there is no RNA and the immunoblot is positive, it means that the person tested had a previous infection but cleared it either with treatment or spontaneously; if the immunoblot is negative, it means that the immunoassay was wrong.  It takes about 6â€“8 weeks following infection before the immunoassay will test positive.  A number of tests are available as point-of-care testing , which can provide results within 30 minutes. Liver enzymes are variable during the initial part of the infection and on average begin to rise at seven weeks after infection.  The elevation of liver enzymes does not closely follow disease severity Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
