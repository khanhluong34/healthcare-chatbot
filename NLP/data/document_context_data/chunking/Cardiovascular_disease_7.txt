Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  Another study reports similar results finding that sex differences explains nearly half the risk associated with cardiovascular diseases One of the proposed explanations for sex differences in cardiovascular diseases is hormonal difference.   Among women, estrogen is the predominant sex hormone.  Estrogen may have protective effects on glucose metabolism and hemostatic system, and may have direct effect in improving endothelial cell function.   The production of estrogen decreases after menopause, and this may change the female lipid metabolism toward a more atherogenic form by decreasing the HDL cholesterol level while increasing LDL and total cholesterol levels. Among men and women, there are differences in body weight, height, body fat distribution, heart rate, stroke volume, and arterial compliance.  In the very elderly, age-related large artery pulsatility and stiffness are more pronounced among women than men.  This may be caused by the women's smaller body size and arterial dimensions which are independent of menopause Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
