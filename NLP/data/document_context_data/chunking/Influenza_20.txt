Influenza Influenza  Children who have not had multiple prior exposures to influenza viruses shed the virus at greater quantities and for a longer duration than other children.  People who are at risk of exposure to influenza include health care workers, social care workers, and those who live with or care for people vulnerable to influenza.  In long-term care facilities, the flu can spread rapidly after it is introduced.  A variety of factors likely encourage influenza transmission, including lower temperature, lower absolute and relative humidity, less ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, and crowding.  Influenza viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract like H1N1 tend to be more mild but more transmissible, whereas those that infect the lower respiratory tract like H5N1 tend to cause more severe illness but are less contagious. In humans, influenza viruses first cause infection by infecting epithelial cells in the respiratory tract.  Illness during infection is primarily the result of lung inflammation and compromise caused by epithelial cell infection and death, combined with inflammation caused by the immune system's response to infection Influenza Influenza
