Migraine Migraine  It is believed that when depolarization travels down the underside of the brain, nerves that sense pain in the head and neck are triggered. The exact mechanism of the head pain which occurs during a migraine episode is unknown.  Some evidence supports a primary role for central nervous system structures , while other data support the role of peripheral activation .  The potential candidate vessels include dural arteries, pial arteries and extracranial arteries such as those of the scalp.  The role of vasodilatation of the extracranial arteries, in particular, is believed to be significant. Adenosine, a neuromodulator, may be involved.  Released after the progressive cleavage of adenosine triphosphate , adenosine acts on adenosine receptors to put the body and brain in a low activity state by dilating blood vessels and slowing the heart rate, such as before and during the early stages of sleep Migraine Migraine
