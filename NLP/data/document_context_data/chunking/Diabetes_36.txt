Diabetes Diabetes The word mellitus  comes from the classical Latin word mellītus, meaning "mellite" .  The Latin word comes from mell-, which comes from mel, meaning "honey"; sweetness; pleasant thing, and the suffix -ītus, whose meaning is the same as that of the English suffix "-ite".  It was Thomas Willis who in 1675 added "mellitus" to the word "diabetes" as a designation for the disease, when he noticed the urine of a person with diabetes had a sweet taste .  This sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, and Persians. The 1989 "St.  Vincent Declaration" was the result of international efforts to improve the care accorded to those with diabetes.  Doing so is important not only in terms of quality of life and life expectancy but also economically – expenses due to diabetes have been shown to be a major drain on health – and productivity-related resources for healthcare systems and governments Diabetes Diabetes
