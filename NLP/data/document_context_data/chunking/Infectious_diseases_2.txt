Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  An infection is not synonymous with an infectious disease, as some infections do not cause illness in a host. As bacterial and viral infections can both cause the same kinds of symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish which is the cause of a specific infection.  Distinguishing the two is important, since viral infections cannot be cured by antibiotics whereas bacterial infections can. There is a general chain of events that applies to infections, sometimes called the chain of infection.  The chain of events involves several steps – which include the infectious agent, reservoir, entering a susceptible host, exit and transmission to new hosts.  Each of the links must be present in a chronological order for an infection to develop.  Understanding these steps helps health care workers target the infection and prevent it from occurring in the first place Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
