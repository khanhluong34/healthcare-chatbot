Influenza Influenza  Antigenic drift is when an influenza virus's antigens change due to the gradual accumulation of mutations in the antigen's  gene.  This can occur in response to evolutionary pressure exerted by the host immune response.  Antigenic drift is especially common for the HA protein, in which just a few amino acid changes in the head region can constitute antigenic drift.  The result is the production of novel strains that can evade pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity.  Antigenic drift occurs in all influenza species but is slower in B than A and slowest in C and D.  Antigenic drift is a major cause of seasonal influenza, and requires that flu vaccines be updated annually.  HA is the main component of inactivated vaccines, so surveillance monitors antigenic drift of this antigen among circulating strains Influenza Influenza
