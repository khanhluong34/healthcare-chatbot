Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease The DASH diet  has been shown to reduce blood pressure, lower total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol  and improve metabolic syndrome; but the long-term benefits have been questioned.  A high-fiber diet is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease. Worldwide, dietary guidelines recommend a reduction in saturated fat, and although the role of dietary fat in cardiovascular disease is complex and controversial there is a long-standing consensus that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat in the diet is sound medical advice.  Total fat intake has not been found to be associated with cardiovascular risk.  A 2020 systematic review found moderate quality evidence that reducing saturated fat intake for at least 2 years caused a reduction in cardiovascular events.   A 2015 meta-analysis of observational studies however did not find a convincing association between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease.   Variation in what is used as a substitute for saturated fat may explain some differences in findings Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
