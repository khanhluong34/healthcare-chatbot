Hepatitis Hepatitis  NASH is recognized as the third most common cause of liver disease in the United States. Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease caused by an abnormal immune response against liver cells.  The disease is thought to have a genetic predisposition as it is associated with certain human leukocyte antigens involved in the immune response.  As in other autoimmune diseases, circulating auto-antibodies may be present and are helpful in diagnosis.  Auto-antibodies found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis include the sensitive but less specific anti-nuclear antibody , smooth muscle antibody , and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody .  Other autoantibodies that are less common but more specific to autoimmune hepatitis are the antibodies against liver kidney microsome 1  and soluble liver antigen .  Autoimmune hepatitis can also be triggered by drugs , after liver transplant, or by viruses  Hepatitis Hepatitis
