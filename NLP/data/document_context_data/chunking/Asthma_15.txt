Asthma Asthma  There may also be involvement of other components of the immune system, including cytokines, chemokines, histamine, and leukotrienes among others. While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.  It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as "a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role.  The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning.  These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment". There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.  Asthma may be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution Asthma Asthma
