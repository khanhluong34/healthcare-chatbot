Obesity Obesity  Because most of the studies on this topic are questionnaire-based, it is possible that these findings overestimate the relationships between personality and obesity: people who are obese might be aware of the social stigma of obesity and their questionnaire responses might be biased accordingly.  Similarly, the personalities of people who are obese as children might be influenced by obesity stigma, rather than these personality factors acting as risk factors for obesity. Two distinct but related processes are considered to be involved in the development of obesity: sustained positive energy balance  and the resetting of the body weight "set point" at an increased value.  The second process explains why finding effective obesity treatments has been difficult.  While the underlying biology of this process still remains uncertain, research is beginning to clarify the mechanisms. At a biological level, there are many possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of obesity.  This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J Obesity Obesity
