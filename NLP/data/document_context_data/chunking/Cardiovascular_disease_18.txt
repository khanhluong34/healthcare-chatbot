Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  Working  with  the  electrolytic production of  aluminium  or  the  production  of  paper  when  the  sulphate pulping  process  is  used  is  associated with heart disease.  An association was also found  between  heart  disease  and  exposure  to  compounds  which  are  no  longer  permitted  in certain  work  environments,  such  as  phenoxy acids containing TCDD or asbestos. Workplace exposure to silica dust or asbestos is also associated with pulmonary heart disease.  There is evidence that workplace  exposure to lead, carbon disulphide, phenoxyacids containing  TCDD, as well as working in an environment where aluminum is being electrolytically produced, is associated with stroke. As of 2017, evidence suggests that certain leukemia-associated mutations in blood cells may also lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Several large-scale research projects looking at human genetic data have found a robust link between the presence of these mutations, a condition known as clonal hematopoiesis, and cardiovascular disease-related incidents and mortality. Radiation treatments for cancer can increase the risk of heart disease and death, as observed in breast cancer therapy Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
