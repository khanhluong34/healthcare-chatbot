These pathogens are also associated with meningitis in people with an impaired immune system.

Recurrent bacterial meningitis may be caused by persisting anatomical defects, either congenital or acquired, or by disorders of the immune system.  Anatomical defects allow continuity between the external environment and the nervous system Meningitis Meningitis
