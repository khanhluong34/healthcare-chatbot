Hepatitis E Hepatitis E During an outbreak in Namibia, the number of affected people rose from 490 in January 2018, to 5014  by April 2019, to 6151 cases  by August 2019; the WHO estimated that the case fatality rate was 0. 9%. In Hong Kong in May 2020,  there were at least 10 cases of hepatitis E that were transmitted by rats, and possibly hundreds of cases that had a transmission mechanism that is not fully understood. The strains of HEV that exist today may have arisen from a shared ancestor virus 536 to 1344 years ago. 
Another analysis has dated the origin of Hepatitis E to ~6000 years ago, with a suggestion that this was associated with domestication of pigs.  At some point, two clades may have diverged — an anthropotropic form and an enzootic form — which subsequently evolved into genotypes 1 and 2 and genotypes 3 and 4, respectively. Whereas genotype 2 remains less commonly detected than other genotypes, genetic evolutionary analyses suggest that genotypes 1, 3, and 4 have spread substantially during the past 100 years Hepatitis E Hepatitis E
