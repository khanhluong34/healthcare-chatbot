Influenza Influenza  Ducks therefore act as key intermediates between wild and domestic birds.  Transmission to poultry typically occurs in backyard farming and live animal markets where multiple species interact with each other.  From there, AIVs can spread to poultry farms in the absence of adequate biosecurity.  Among poultry, HPAI transmission occurs through aerosols and contaminated feces, cages, feed, and dead animals.  Back-transmission of HPAI viruses from poultry to wild birds has occurred and is implicated in mass die-offs and intercontinental spread. AIVs have occasionally infected humans through aerosols, fomites, and contaminated water.  Direction transmission from wild birds is rare Influenza Influenza
