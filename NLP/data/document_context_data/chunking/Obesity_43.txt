Obesity Obesity Public perceptions in Western society regarding healthy body weight differ from those regarding the weight that is considered ideal  – and both have changed since the beginning of the 20th century.  The weight that is viewed as an ideal has become lower since the 1920s.  This is illustrated by the fact that the average height of Miss America pageant winners increased by 2% from 1922 to 1999, while their average weight decreased by 12%.  On the other hand, people's views concerning healthy weight have changed in the opposite direction.  In Britain, the weight at which people considered themselves to be overweight was significantly higher in 2007 than in 1999.  These changes are believed to be due to increasing rates of adiposity leading to increased acceptance of extra body fat as being normal. Obesity is still seen as a sign of wealth and well-being in many parts of Africa Obesity Obesity
