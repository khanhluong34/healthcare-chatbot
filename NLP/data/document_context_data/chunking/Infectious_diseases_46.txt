Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups, which may reduce pathogen transmission, or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture.  Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior, which may reduce pathogen transmission.  It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates.  Higher fertility rates and shorter or less parental care per child is another association that may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate.  There is also an association with polygyny which may be due to higher pathogen load, making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important.  Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism, which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections.  There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
