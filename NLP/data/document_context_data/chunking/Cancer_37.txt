Cancer Cancer  For example, the most common type of breast cancer is called ductal carcinoma of the breast.  Here, the adjective ductal refers to the appearance of cancer under the microscope, which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts. Benign tumors  are named using -oma as a suffix with the organ name as the root.  For example, a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a leiomyoma .  Confusingly, some types of cancer use the -noma suffix, examples including melanoma and seminoma. Some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope, such as giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma.
