Influenza Influenza  Non-respiratory organs can become involved, but the mechanisms by which influenza is involved in these cases are unknown.  Severe respiratory illness can be caused by multiple, non-exclusive mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity due to epithelial cell infection and death, and degradation of the extracellular matrix that maintains lung structure.  In particular, alveolar cell infection appears to drive severe symptoms since this results in impaired gas exchange and enables viruses to infect endothelial cells, which produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pneumonia caused by influenza viruses is characterized by high levels of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, accompanied by a strong pro-inflammatory response called a cytokine storm.  Infection with H5N1 or H7N9 especially produces high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  In bacterial infections, early depletion of macrophages during influenza creates a favorable environment in the lungs for bacterial growth since these white blood cells are important in responding to bacterial infection.  Host mechanisms to encourage tissue repair may inadvertently allow bacterial infection Influenza Influenza
