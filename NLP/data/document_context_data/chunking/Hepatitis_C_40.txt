Hepatitis C Hepatitis C  More studies are needed to investigate the role of the preventive antiviral medication against HCV recurrence after transplantation. One barrier to finding treatments for hepatitis C is the lack of a suitable animal model.  Despite moderate success, research highlights the need for pre-clinical testing in mammalian systems such as mouse, particularly for the development of vaccines in poorer communities.  Chimpanzees remain the only available living system to study, yet their use has ethical concerns and regulatory restrictions.  While scientists have made use of human cell culture systems such as hepatocytes, questions have been raised about their accuracy in reflecting the body's response to infection. One aspect of hepatitis research is to reproduce infections in mammalian models.  A strategy is to introduce liver tissues from humans into mice, a technique known as xenotransplantation Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
