Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease  ICAM-1 propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes  into inflamed tissue.  Increased expression of ICAM-1 has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of people with ulcerative colitis, pouchitis and Crohn's, where ICAM-1 over production correlated with disease activity.  This suggests that ICAM-1 is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of these diseases. Cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonists are found to decrease the induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 surface expression in human brain tissues and primary human brain endothelial cells  exposed to various pro-inflammatory mediators. In 2014, an alliance among the Broad Institute, Amgen and Massachusetts General Hospital formed with the intention to "collect and analyze patient DNA samples to identify and further validate genetic targets. "In 2015, a meta-analysis on 938 IBD patients and 953 controls, IBD was significantly associated with having higher odds of vitamin D deficiency. Gram-positive bacteria present in the lumen could be associated with extending the time of relapse for ulcerative colitis Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
