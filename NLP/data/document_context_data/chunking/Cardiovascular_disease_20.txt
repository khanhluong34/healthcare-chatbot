Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease Obesity and diabetes mellitus are linked to cardiovascular disease, as are a history of chronic kidney disease and hypercholesterolaemia.   In fact, cardiovascular disease is the most life-threatening of the diabetic complications and diabetics are two- to four-fold more likely to die of cardiovascular-related causes than nondiabetics. Screening ECGs  are not recommended in those without symptoms who are at low risk.  This includes those who are young without risk factors.  In those at higher risk the evidence for screening with ECGs is inconclusive.  Additionally echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, and cardiac stress testing is not recommended in those at low risk who do not have symptoms.  Some biomarkers may add to conventional cardiovascular risk factors in predicting the risk of future cardiovascular disease; however, the value of some biomarkers is questionable Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
