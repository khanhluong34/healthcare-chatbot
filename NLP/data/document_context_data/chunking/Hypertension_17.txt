Hypertension Hypertension Initial assessment of the hypertensive people should include a complete history and physical examination.  Serum creatinine is measured to assess for the presence of kidney disease, which can be either the cause or the result of hypertension.  Serum creatinine alone may overestimate glomerular filtration rate and the 2003 JNC7 guidelines advocate the use of predictive equations such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease  formula to estimate glomerular filtration rate .  eGFR can also provide a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain anti-hypertensive drugs on kidney function.  Additionally, testing of urine samples for protein is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease.  Electrocardiogram  testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure.  It may also show whether there is thickening of the heart muscle  or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor disturbance such as a silent heart attack Hypertension Hypertension
