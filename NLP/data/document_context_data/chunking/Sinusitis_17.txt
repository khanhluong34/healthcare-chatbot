Sinusitis Sinusitis For cases of maxillary sinusitis, limited field CBCT imaging, as compared to periapical radiographs, improves the ability to detect the teeth as the sources for sinusitis.  A coronal CT picture may also be useful. For sinusitis lasting more than 12 weeks, a CT scan is recommended.  On a CT scan, acute sinus secretions have a radiodensity of 10 to 25 Hounsfield units , but in a more chronic state they become more viscous, with a radiodensity of 30 to 60 HU. Nasal endoscopy and clinical symptoms are also used to make a positive diagnosis.  A tissue sample for histology and cultures can also be collected and tested.  Nasal endoscopy involves inserting a flexible fiber-optic tube with a light and camera at its tip into the nose to examine the nasal passages and sinuses Sinusitis Sinusitis
