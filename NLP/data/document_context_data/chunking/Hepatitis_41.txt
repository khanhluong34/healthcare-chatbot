Hepatitis Hepatitis  Fulminant hepatitis most commonly occurs in hepatitis B, D, and E.  About 1â€“2% of cases of hepatitis E can lead to fulminant hepatitis, but pregnant women are particularly susceptible, occurring in up to 20% of cases.  Mortality rates in cases of fulminant hepatitis rise over 80%, but those patients that do survive often make a complete recovery.  Liver transplantation can be life-saving in patients with fulminant liver failure. Hepatitis D infections can transform benign cases of hepatitis B into severe, progressive hepatitis, a phenomenon known as superinfection. Acute hepatitis B infections become less likely to progress to chronic forms as the age of the patient increases, with rates of progression approaching 90% in vertically transmitted cases of infants compared to 1% risk in young adults.  Overall, the five-year survival rate for chronic hepatitis B ranges from 97% in mild cases to 55% in severe cases with cirrhosis Hepatitis Hepatitis
