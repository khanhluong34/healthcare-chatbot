Sinusitis Sinusitis 5 to 2. 0% of viral rhinosinusitis  will develop into bacterial infections in adults and 5 to 10% in children. Biofilm bacterial infections may account for many cases of antibiotic-refractory chronic sinusitis.  Biofilms are complex aggregates of extracellular matrix and interdependent microorganisms from multiple species, many of which may be difficult or impossible to isolate using standard clinical laboratory techniques.  Bacteria found in biofilms have their antibiotic resistance increased up to 1000 times when compared to free-living bacteria of the same species.   A recent study found that biofilms were present on the mucosa of 75% of people undergoing surgery for chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis  is defined as an inflammation of the mucous membrane that lines the paranasal sinuses and is classified chronologically into several categories:Roughly 90% of adults have had sinusitis at some point in their lives Sinusitis Sinusitis
