Hepatitis Hepatitis  A 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis found that Lamivudine initiated early in the third trimester also significantly reduced mother-to-child transmission of HBV, without any known adverse effects. The ACOG states that the evidence available does not suggest any particular mode of delivery  is better at reducing vertical transmission in mothers with HBV. The WHO and CDC recommend that neonates born to mothers with HBV should receive hepatitis B immune globulin  as well as the HBV vaccine within 12 hours of birth.  For infants who have received HBIG and the HBV vaccine, breastfeeding is safe. Estimates of the rate of HCV vertical transmission range from 2â€“8%; a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found the risk to be 5. 8% in HCV-positive, HIV-negative women.  The same study found the risk of vertical transmission to be 10 Hepatitis Hepatitis
