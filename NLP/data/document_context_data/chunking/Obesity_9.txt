Obesity Obesity  The number of people considered metabolically healthy depends on the definition used, and there is no universally accepted definition.  There are numerous obese people who have relatively few metabolic abnormalities, and a minority of obese people have no medical complications.  The guidelines of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists call for physicians to use risk stratification with obese patients when considering how to assess their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. : 59–60In 2014, the BioSHaRE–EU Healthy Obese Project  came up with two definitions for healthy obesity, one more strict and one less so:To come up with these criteria, BioSHaRE controlled for age and tobacco use, researching how both may effect the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity, but not found to exist in the metabolically healthy obese.  Other definitions of metabolically healthy obesity exist, including ones based on waist circumference rather than BMI, which is unreliable in certain individuals. Another identification metric for health in obese people is calf strength, which is positively correlated with physical fitness in obese people.  Body composition in general is hypothesized to help explain the existence of metabolically healthy obesity—the metabolically healthy obese are often found to have low amounts of ectopic fat  despite having overall fat mass equivalent in weight to obese people with metabolic syndrome Obesity Obesity
