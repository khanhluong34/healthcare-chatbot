Diabetes Diabetes  Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy.  Management may include dietary changes, blood glucose monitoring, and in some cases, insulin may be required. Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother.  Risks to the baby include macrosomia , congenital heart and central nervous system abnormalities, and skeletal muscle malformations.  Increased levels of insulin in a fetus's blood may inhibit fetal surfactant production and cause infant respiratory distress syndrome.  A high blood bilirubin level may result from red blood cell destruction.  In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor placental perfusion due to vascular impairment Diabetes Diabetes
