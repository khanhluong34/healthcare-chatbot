Cancer Cancer Targeted therapy is a form of chemotherapy that targets specific molecular differences between cancer and normal cells.  The first targeted therapies blocked the estrogen receptor molecule, inhibiting the growth of breast cancer.  Another common example is the class of Bcr-Abl inhibitors, which are used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia .  Currently, targeted therapies exist for many of the most common cancer types, including bladder cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, and thyroid cancer as well as other cancer types. The efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage.  In combination with surgery, chemotherapy has proven useful in cancer types including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and certain lung cancers.  Chemotherapy is curative for some cancers, such as some leukemias, ineffective in some brain tumors, and needless in others, such as most non-melanoma skin cancers Cancer Cancer
