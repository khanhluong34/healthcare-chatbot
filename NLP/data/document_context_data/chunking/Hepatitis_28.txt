Hepatitis Hepatitis The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease. For children 12 months of age or older, the vaccination is given as a shot into the muscle in two doses 6–18 months apart and should be started before the age 24 months.   The dosing is slightly different for adults depending on the type of the vaccine.   If the vaccine is for hepatitis A only, two doses are given 6–18 months apart depending on the manufacturer.   If the vaccine is combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B, up to 4 doses may be required. The CDC recommends the routine vaccination of all children under the age of 19 with the hepatitis B vaccine.  They also recommend it for those who desire it or are at high risk Hepatitis Hepatitis
