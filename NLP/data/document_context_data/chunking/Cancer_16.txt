Cancer Cancer Ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen.  Residential exposure to radon gas, for example, has similar cancer risks as passive smoking.  Radiation is a more potent source of cancer when combined with other cancer-causing agents, such as radon plus tobacco smoke.  Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals and at any age.  Children are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults; radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect. Medical use of ionizing radiation is a small but growing source of radiation-induced cancers.  Ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers, but this may, in some cases, induce a second form of cancer Cancer Cancer
