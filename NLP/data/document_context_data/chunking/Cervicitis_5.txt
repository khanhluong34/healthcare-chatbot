Cervicitis Cervicitis  Women with infectious cervicitis should be tested for other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and syphilis. Cervicitis should be followed up.  Women with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas should see a clinician in three months after treatment for repeat testing because they are at higher risk of getting reinfected, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated.  Treatment in pregnant women is the same as those who are not pregnant.  Cervicitis Cervicitis
