Influenza Influenza  The reported number of influenza cases is usually much lower than the actual number of cases. During seasonal epidemics, it is estimated that about 80% of otherwise healthy people who have a cough or sore throat have the flu.  Approximately 30–40% of people hospitalized for influenza develop pneumonia, and about 5% of all severe pneumonia cases in hospitals are due to influenza, which is also the most common cause of ARDS in adults.  In children, influenza is one of the two most common causes of ARDS, the other being the respiratory syncytial virus.  About 3–5% of children each year develop otitis media due to influenza.  Adults who develop organ failure from influenza and children who have PIM scores and acute renal failure have higher rates of mortality.  During seasonal influenza, mortality is concentrated in the very young and the elderly, whereas during flu pandemics, young adults are often affected at a high rate Influenza Influenza
