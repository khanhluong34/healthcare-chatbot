Cancer Cancer  Oncogenes are genes that promote cell growth and reproduction.  Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division and survival.  Malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes, the inappropriate over-expression of normal oncogenes, or by the under-expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes.  Typically, changes in multiple genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell. Genetic changes can occur at different levels and by different mechanisms.  The gain or loss of an entire chromosome can occur through errors in mitosis.  More common are mutations, which are changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA Cancer Cancer
