Hepatitis C Hepatitis C  As a result, the number of chronic patients receiving treatment worldwide has grown from about 950,000 in 2015 to 9. 4 million in 2019.  During the same period, hepatitis C deaths declined from about 400,000 to 290,000. Previously, a 2013 study found high infection rates  in Central and East Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, intermediate infection rates  in South and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Andean, Central and Southern Latin America, Caribbean, Oceania, Australasia and Central, Eastern and Western Europe; and low infection rates  in Asia-Pacific, Tropical Latin America and North America. Among those chronically infected, the risk of cirrhosis after 20 years varies between studies but has been estimated at ~10–15% for men and ~1–5% for women.  The reason for this difference is not known.  Once cirrhosis is established, the rate of developing hepatocellular carcinoma is ~1–4% per year Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
