Meningitis Meningitis  The term aseptic meningitis refers to cases of meningitis in which no bacterial infection can be demonstrated.  This type of meningitis is usually caused by viruses, but it may be due to bacterial infection that has already been partially treated, when bacteria disappear from the meninges, or when pathogens infect a space adjacent to the meninges .  Endocarditis  may cause aseptic meningitis.  Aseptic meningitis may also result from infection with spirochetes, a group of bacteria that includes Treponema pallidum  and Borrelia burgdorferi , and may also result from cerebral malaria . The types of bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis vary according to the infected individual's age group. A head injury potentially allows nasal cavity bacteria to enter the meningeal space.  Similarly, devices in the brain and meninges, such as cerebral shunts, extraventricular drains or Ommaya reservoirs, carry an increased risk of meningitis Meningitis Meningitis
