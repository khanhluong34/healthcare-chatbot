Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease For ulcerative colitis, there is low-certainty evidence that probiotic supplements may increase the probability of clinical remission.  People receiving probiotics were 73% more likely to experience disease remission and over 2x as likely to report improvement in symptoms compared to those receiving a placebo, with no clear difference in minor or serious adverse effects.  Although there was no clear evidence of greater remission when probiotic supplements were compared with 5‚Äêaminosalicylic acid treatment as a monotherapy, the likelihood of remission was 22% higher if probiotics were used in combination with 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy.
