Influenza Influenza  Four influenza pandemics have occurred since WWII, each less severe than the 1918 pandemic.  The first of these was the Asian flu from 1957 to 1958, caused by an H2N2 strain and beginning in China's Yunnan province.  The number of deaths probably exceeded one million, mostly among the very young and very old.  The 1957 pandemic was the first flu pandemic to occur in the presence of a global surveillance system and laboratories able to study the novel influenza virus.  After the pandemic, H2N2 was the IAV subtype responsible for seasonal influenza.  The first antiviral drug against influenza, amantadine, was approved for use in 1966, with additional antiviral drugs being used since the 1990s. In 1968, H3N2 was introduced into humans through a rearrangement between an avian H3N2 strain and an H2N2 strain that was circulating in humans Influenza Influenza
