Influenza Influenza Influenza, commonly known as "the flu", is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses.  Symptoms range from mild to severe and often include fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pain, headache, coughing, and fatigue.  These symptoms begin from one to four days after exposure to the virus  and last for about 2â€“8 days.  Diarrhea and vomiting can occur, particularly in children.  Influenza may progress to pneumonia, which can be caused by the virus or by a subsequent bacterial infection.  Other complications of infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and worsening of pre-existing health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.
