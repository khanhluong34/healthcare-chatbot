Hepatitis B Hepatitis B The primary method of HBV transmission and the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in specific regions often correspond with one another.  In populations where HBV infection rates are 8% or higher, which are classified as high prevalence, vertical transmission  is most common, though rates of early childhood transmission can also be significant among these populations.  In 2021, 19 African countries had infection rates ranging between 8-19%, placing them in the high prevalence category. In moderate prevalence areas where 2â€“7% of the population is chronically infected, the disease is predominantly spread horizontally, often among children, or vertically.  China's HBV infection rate is at the higher end of the moderate prevalence classification with an infection rate of 6. 89% as of 2019.  HBV prevalence in India is also moderate, with studies placing India's infection rate between 2-4% Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
