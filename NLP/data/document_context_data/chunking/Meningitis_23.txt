Since the 1980s, many countries have included immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type B in their routine childhood vaccination schemes.  This has practically eliminated this pathogen as a cause of meningitis in young children in those countries.  In the countries in which the disease burden is highest, however, the vaccine is still too expensive.  Similarly, immunization against mumps has led to a sharp fall in the number of cases of mumps meningitis, which prior to vaccination occurred in 15% of all cases of mumps. Meningococcus vaccines exist against groups A, B, C, W135 and Y.   In countries where the vaccine for meningococcus group C was introduced, cases caused by this pathogen have decreased substantially Meningitis Meningitis
