Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  In women, the increase continues sharply until age 60 to 65 years. Aging is also associated with changes in the mechanical and structural properties of the vascular wall, which leads to the loss of arterial elasticity and reduced arterial compliance and may subsequently lead to coronary artery disease. Men are at greater risk of heart disease than pre-menopausal women.  Once past menopause, it has been argued that a woman's risk is similar to a man's although more recent data from the WHO and UN disputes this.  If a female has diabetes, she is more likely to develop heart disease than a male with diabetes. Coronary heart diseases are 2 to 5 times more common among middle-aged men than women.   In a study done by the World Health Organization, sex contributes to approximately 40% of the variation in sex ratios of coronary heart disease mortality Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
