Influenza Influenza  In humans, a sizeable antibody response occurs ~1 week after viral exposure.  This antibody response is typically robust and long-lasting, especially for ICV and IDV.  In other words, people exposed to a certain strain in childhood still possess antibodies to that strain at a reasonable level later in life, which can provide some protection to related strains.  There is, however, an "original antigenic sin", in which the first HA subtype a person is exposed to influences the antibody-based immune response to future infections and vaccines. Annual vaccination is the primary and most effective way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated complications, especially for high-risk groups.  Vaccines against the flu are trivalent or quadrivalent, providing protection against an H1N1 strain, an H3N2 strain, and one or two IBV strains corresponding to the two IBV lineages.  Two types of vaccines are in use: inactivated vaccines that contain "killed"  viruses and live attenuated influenza vaccines  that contain weakened viruses Influenza Influenza
