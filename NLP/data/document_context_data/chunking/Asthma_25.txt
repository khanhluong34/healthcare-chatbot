Asthma Asthma  This type of history has been labelled the "infectious asthma"  syndrome, or as "asthma associated with infection"  to distinguish infection-associated asthma initiation from the well known association of respiratory infections with asthma exacerbations.  Reported prevalences of IA for adults range from around 40% in a primary care practice to 70% in a specialty practice treating mainly severe asthma patients.  The true population prevalence  of IA in adult-onset asthma is unknown because clinicians are not trained to elicit this type of history routinely, and recollection in child-onset asthma is challenging. Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma.  In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.  Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.  According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term "asthma" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways Asthma Asthma
