Influenza Influenza  Instead, most transmission involves domestic poultry, mainly chickens, ducks, and geese but also a variety of other birds such as guinea fowl, partridge, pheasants, and quails.  The primary risk factor for infection with AIVs is exposure to birds in farms and live poultry markets.  Typically, infection with an AIV has an incubation period of 3â€“5 days but can be up to 9 days.  H5N1 and H7N9 cause severe lower respiratory tract illness, whereas other AIVs such as H9N2 cause a more mild upper respiratory tract illness, commonly with conjunctivitis.  Limited transmission of avian H2, H5-7, H9, and H10 subtypes from one person to another through respiratory droplets, aerosols, and fomites has occurred, but sustained human-to-human transmission of AIVs has not occurred.  Before 2013, H5N1 was the most common AIV to infect humans.  Since then, H7N9 has been responsible for most human cases Influenza Influenza
