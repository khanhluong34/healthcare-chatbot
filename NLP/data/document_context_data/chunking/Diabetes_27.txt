Diabetes Diabetes  When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications. Some severe cases of type 2 diabetes may also be treated with insulin, which is increased gradually until glucose targets are reached. Cardiovascular disease is a serious complication associated with diabetes, and many international guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment targets that are lower than 140/90 mmHg for people with diabetes.  However, there is only limited evidence regarding what the lower targets should be.  A 2016 systematic review found potential harm to treating to targets lower than 140 mmHg, and a subsequent systematic review in 2019 found no evidence of additional benefit from blood pressure lowering to between 130 – 140mmHg, although there was an increased risk of adverse events. 2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events, and death.  There is some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  are superior to other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin receptor blockers , or aliskiren in preventing cardiovascular disease Diabetes Diabetes
