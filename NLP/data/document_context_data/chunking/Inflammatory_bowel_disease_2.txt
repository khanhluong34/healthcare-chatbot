Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease Gluten sensitivity is common in IBD and associated with having flareups.  Gluten sensitivity was reported in 23. 6% and 27. 3% of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively. A diet high in protein, particularly animal protein, and/or high in sugar may be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses. Emerging evidence indicates that bile acids are important etiological agents in IBD pathogenesis.   IBD patients have a consistent pattern of an increased abundance of primary bile acids such as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid , and a decreased abundance of secondary bile acids such as lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
