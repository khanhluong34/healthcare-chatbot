Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease  The choice of which drugs to use and by which route to administer them  depends on factors including the type, distribution, and severity of the patient's disease, as well as other historical and biochemical prognostic factors, and patient preferences.  For example, mesalazine is more useful in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease.  Generally, depending on the level of severity, IBD may require immunosuppression to control the symptoms, with drugs such as prednisone, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors , azathioprine, methotrexate, or 6-mercaptopurine. Steroids, such as the glucocorticoid prednisone, are frequently used to control disease flares and were once acceptable as a maintenance drug.  Biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease, especially the TNF inhibitors, are used in people with more severe or resistant Crohn's disease and sometimes in ulcerative colitis. Treatment is usually started by administering drugs with high anti-inflammatory effects, such as prednisone.  Once the inflammation is successfully controlled, another drug to keep the disease in remission, such as mesalazine in UC, is the main treatment Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
