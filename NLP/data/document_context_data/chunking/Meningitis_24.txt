Meningitis Meningitis  A quadrivalent vaccine now exists, which combines four vaccines with the exception of B; immunization with this ACW135Y vaccine is now a visa requirement for taking part in Hajj.  Development of a vaccine against group B meningococci has proved much more difficult, as its surface proteins  only elicit a weak response from the immune system, or cross-react with normal human proteins.  Still, some countries  have developed vaccines against local strains of group B meningococci; some have shown good results and are used in local immunization schedules.  Two new vaccines, both approved in 2014, are effective against a wider range of group B meningococci strains.  In Africa, until recently, the approach for prevention and control of meningococcal epidemics was based on early detection of the disease and emergency reactive mass vaccination of the at-risk population with bivalent A/C or trivalent A/C/W135 polysaccharide vaccines, though the introduction of MenAfriVac  has demonstrated effectiveness in young people and has been described as a model for product development partnerships in resource-limited settings. Routine vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine , which is active against seven common serotypes of this pathogen, significantly reduces the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis.  The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, which covers 23 strains, is only administered to certain groups ; it does not elicit a significant immune response in all recipients, e Meningitis Meningitis
