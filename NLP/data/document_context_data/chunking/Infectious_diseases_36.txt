Infectious diseases Infectious diseases The organism that is the target of an infecting action of a specific infectious agent is called the host.  The host harbouring an agent that is in a mature or sexually active stage phase is called the definitive host.  The intermediate host comes in contact during the larvae stage.  A host can be anything living and can attain to asexual and sexual reproduction. 
The clearance of the pathogens, either treatment-induced or spontaneous, it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients.  For instance, for genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b  combined with ribavirin, it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in the treatment-induced clearance of the virus.  This finding, originally reported in Nature, showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
