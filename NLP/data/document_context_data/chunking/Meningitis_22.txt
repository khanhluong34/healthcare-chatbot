Meningitis Meningitis  The findings from a post mortem are usually a widespread inflammation of the pia mater and arachnoid layers of the meninges.  Neutrophil granulocytes tend to have migrated to the cerebrospinal fluid and the base of the brain, along with cranial nerves and the spinal cord, may be surrounded with pus – as may the meningeal vessels. For some causes of meningitis, protection can be provided in the long term through vaccination, or in the short term with antibiotics.  Some behavioral measures may also be effective. Bacterial and viral meningitis are contagious, but neither is as contagious as the common cold or flu.  Both can be transmitted through droplets of respiratory secretions during close contact such as kissing, sneezing or coughing on someone, but bacterial meningitis cannot be spread by only breathing the air where a person with meningitis has been.  Viral meningitis is typically caused by enteroviruses, and is most commonly spread through fecal contamination Meningitis Meningitis
