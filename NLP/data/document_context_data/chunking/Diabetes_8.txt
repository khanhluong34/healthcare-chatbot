Diabetes Diabetes Type 1 diabetes is characterized by loss of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreatic islets, leading to insulin deficiency.  This type can be further classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic.  The majority of type 1 diabetes is of an immune-mediated nature, in which a T cell-mediated autoimmune attack leads to the loss of beta cells and thus insulin.  It causes approximately 10% of diabetes mellitus cases in North America and Europe.  Most affected people are otherwise healthy and of a healthy weight when onset occurs.  Sensitivity and responsiveness to insulin are usually normal, especially in the early stages.  Although it has been called "juvenile diabetes" due to the frequent onset in children, the majority of individuals living with type 1 diabetes are now adults Diabetes Diabetes
