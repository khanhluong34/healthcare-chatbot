Back pain Back pain  X-rays are a less costly initial option offered to patients with a low clinical suspicion of infection or malignancy, and they are combined with laboratory studies for interpretation. Imaging is not needed for the majority of patients with back pain.  In cases of acute back pain, MRI is recommended for those with major risk factors or clinical suspicion of cancer, spinal infection or severe progressive neurological deficits.  For patients with subacute to chronic back pain, MRI is recommended if minor risk factors exist for cancer, ankylosing spondylitis or vertebral compression fracture, or if significant trauma or symptomatic spinal stenosis is present. Early imaging studies during the acute phase do not improve care or prognosis.  Imaging findings are not correlated with severity or outcome. Laboratory studies are employed when there are suspicions of autoimmune causes, infection or malignancy Back pain Back pain
