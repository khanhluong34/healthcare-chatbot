Cancer Cancer  Many studies of heavy metal-induced carcinogenesis show that such heavy metals cause a reduction in expression of DNA repair enzymes, some through epigenetic mechanisms.  DNA repair inhibition is proposed to be a predominant mechanism in heavy metal-induced carcinogenicity.  In addition, frequent epigenetic alterations of the DNA sequences code for small RNAs called microRNAs .  miRNAs do not code for proteins, but can "target" protein-coding genes and reduce their expression. Cancers usually arise from an assemblage of mutations and epimutations that confer a selective advantage leading to clonal expansion .  Mutations, however, may not be as frequent in cancers as epigenetic alterations.  An average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein-altering mutations, of which about three or four may be "driver" mutations and the remaining ones may be "passenger" mutations Cancer Cancer
