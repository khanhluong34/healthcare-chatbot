Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease IBD is a complex disease which arises as a result of the interaction of environmental and genetic factors leading to immunological responses and inflammation in the intestine. People living with IBD are very interested in diet, but little is known about the impact of diet on these patients.  Recent reviews underlined the important role of nutritional counselling in IBD patients.  Patients should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation. A 2022 study found that diets with increased intake of fruits and vegetables, reduction of processed meats and refined carbohydrates, and preference of water for hydration were associated with lower risk of active symptoms with IBD, although increased intake of fruits and vegetables alone did not reduce risk of symptoms with Crohn's disease. Dietary patterns are associated with a risk for ulcerative colitis.  In particular, subjects who were in the highest tertile of the healthy dietary pattern had a 79% lower risk of ulcerative colitis Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
