Asthma Asthma  Common indoor allergens include dust mites, cockroaches, animal dander , and mold.  Efforts to decrease dust mites have been found to be ineffective on symptoms in sensitized subjects.  Weak evidence suggests that efforts to decrease mold by repairing buildings may help improve asthma symptoms in adults.  Certain viral respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus, may increase the risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children.  Certain other infections, however, may decrease the risk. The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses.  It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies Asthma Asthma
