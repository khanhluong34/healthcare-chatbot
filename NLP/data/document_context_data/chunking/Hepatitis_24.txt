Hepatitis Hepatitis  The combination of antigen and antibody positivity can provide information about the stage of infection , the degree of viral replication, and the infectivity of the virus. The most apparent distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis  and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  is a history of excessive alcohol use.  Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis.  In those who drink alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.  In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1. 5:1. Liver biopsies show identical findings in patients with ASH and NASH, specifically, the presence of polymorphonuclear infiltration, hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis in the form of ballooning degeneration, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis around veins and sinuses Hepatitis Hepatitis
