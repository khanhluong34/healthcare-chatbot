Hepatitis Hepatitis Most patients who acquire hepatitis D at the same time as hepatitis B  recover without developing a chronic infection.  In people with hepatitis B who later acquire hepatitis D , chronic infection is much more common at 80â€“90%, and liver disease progression is accelerated. Chronic hepatitis C progresses towards cirrhosis, with estimates of cirrhosis prevalence of 16% at 20 years after infection.  While the major causes of mortality in hepatitis C is end stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma is an important additional long term complication and cause of death in chronic hepatitis. Rates of mortality increase with progression of the underlying liver disease.  Series of patients with compensated cirrhosis due to HCV have shown 3,5, and 10-year survival rates of 96, 91, and 79% respectively.   The 5-year survival rate drops to 50% upon if the cirrhosis becomes decompensated Hepatitis Hepatitis
