Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely, at some point, on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent.  Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments, such as the compound light microscope, or with instruments as complex as an electron microscope.  Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope, and can often rapidly lead to identification.  Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques, and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques.  For example, the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent  can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen.  A fluorescence microscope is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells.  This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases, where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
