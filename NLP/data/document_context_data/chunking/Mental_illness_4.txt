Mental illness Mental illness  It has been noted that using the term "mental"  is not necessarily meant to imply separateness from the brain or body. According to DSM-IV, a mental disorder is a psychological syndrome or pattern that is associated with distress , disability , increased risk of death, or causes a significant loss of autonomy; however, it excludes normal responses such as grief from loss of a loved one and also excludes deviant behavior for political, religious, or societal reasons not arising from a dysfunction in the individual. DSM-IV predicates the definition with caveats, stating that, as in the case with many medical terms, mental disorder "lacks a consistent operational definition that covers all situations", noting that different levels of abstraction can be used for medical definitions, including pathology, symptomology, deviance from a normal range, or etiology, and that the same is true for mental disorders so that sometimes one type of definition is appropriate, and sometimes another, depending on the situation. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association  redefined mental disorders in the DSM-5 as "a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. " The final draft of ICD-11 contains a very similar definition. The terms "mental breakdown" or "nervous breakdown" may be used by the general population to mean a mental disorder.  The terms "nervous breakdown" and "mental breakdown" have not been formally defined through a medical diagnostic system such as the DSM-5 or ICD-10, and are nearly absent from scientific literature regarding mental illness Mental illness Mental illness
