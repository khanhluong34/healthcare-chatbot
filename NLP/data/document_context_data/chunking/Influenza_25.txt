Influenza Influenza  There are three types of inactivated vaccines: whole virus, split virus, in which the virus is disrupted by a detergent, and subunit, which only contains the viral antigens HA and NA.  Most flu vaccines are inactivated and administered via intramuscular injection.  LAIVs are sprayed into the nasal cavity. Vaccination recommendations vary by country.  Some recommend vaccination for all people above a certain age, such as 6 months, whereas other countries recommendation is limited for high at risk groups, such as pregnant women, young children , the elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, health care workers, people who come into contact with high-risk people, and people who transmit the virus easily.  Young infants cannot receive flu vaccines for safety reasons, but they can inherit passive immunity from their mother if inactivated vaccines are administered to the mother during pregnancy.  Influenza vaccination also helps to reduce the probability of reassortment Influenza Influenza
