Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  Some of these risk factors, such as age, sex or family history/genetic predisposition, are immutable; however, many important cardiovascular risk factors are modifiable by lifestyle change, social change, drug treatment .  People with obesity are at increased risk of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. Cardiovascular disease in a person's parents increases their risk by ~3 fold, and genetics is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.  Genetic cardiovascular disease can occur either as
a consequence of single variant  or polygenic influences.  There are more than 40 inherited cardiovascular disease that can be traced to a single disease-causing DNA variant, although these conditions are rare.  Most common cardiovascular diseases are non-Mendelian and are thought to be due to hundreds or thousands of genetic variants , each associated with a small effect. Age is the most important risk factor in developing cardiovascular or heart diseases, with approximately a tripling of risk with each decade of life Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
