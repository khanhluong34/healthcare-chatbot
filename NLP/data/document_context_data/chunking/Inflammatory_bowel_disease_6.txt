Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease  One of the largest genetic studies of IBD was published in 2012.  The analysis explained more of the variance in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than previously reported.  The results suggested that commensal microbiota are altered in such a way that they act as pathogens in inflammatory bowel diseases.  Other studies show that mutations in IBD-associated genes might interfere with the cellular activity and interactions with the microbiome that promote normal immune responses.  Many studies identified that microRNAs dysregulation involved in IBD and to promote colorectal cancer.  By 2020, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was launched by a small consortium using IBD patient biopsy material in a search for therapeutic targets. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by biopsies on colonoscopy Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
