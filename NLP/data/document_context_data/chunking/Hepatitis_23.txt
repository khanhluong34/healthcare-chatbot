Hepatitis Hepatitis  Unlike steatosis and cirrhosis, no imaging test is able to detect liver inflammation  or fibrosis.  Liver biopsy is the only definitive diagnostic test that is able to assess inflammation and fibrosis of the liver. Viral hepatitis is primarily diagnosed through blood tests for levels of viral antigens , anti-viral antibodies , or viral DNA/RNA.  In early infection , IgM antibodies are found in the blood.  In late infection and after recovery, IgG antibodies are present and remain in the body for up to years.  Therefore, when a patient is positive for IgG antibody but negative for IgM antibody, he is considered immune from the virus via either prior infection and recovery or prior vaccination. In the case of hepatitis B, blood tests exist for multiple virus antigens  and antibodies Hepatitis Hepatitis
