Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection.  However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host.  The infectious virion contains an inner "core particle" enclosing viral genome.  The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of the core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBcAg.  During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies specific to the hepatitis B core antigen  may be the only serological evidence of disease.   Therefore, most hepatitis B diagnostic panels contain HBsAg and total anti-HBc . Shortly after the appearance of the HBsAg, another antigen called hepatitis B e antigen  will appear Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
