Hypertension Hypertension  These sentinel SNP are located within genes related to vascular smooth muscle and renal function.  DNA methylation might affect in some way linking common genetic variation to multiple phenotypes even though mechanisms underlying these associations are not understood.  Single variant test performed in this study for the 35 sentinel SNP  showed that genetic variants singly or in aggregate contribute to risk of clinical phenotypes related to high blood pressure. Blood pressure rises with aging when associated with a western diet and lifestyle and the risk of becoming hypertensive in later life is significant.  Several environmental factors influence blood pressure.  High salt intake raises the blood pressure in salt sensitive individuals; lack of exercise and central obesity can play a role in individual cases.  The possible roles of other factors such as caffeine consumption, and vitamin D deficiency are less clear Hypertension Hypertension
