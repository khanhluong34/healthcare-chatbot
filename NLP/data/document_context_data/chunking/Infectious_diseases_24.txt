Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Some viral infections can also be latent, examples of latent viral infections are any of those from the Herpesviridae family. The word infection can denote any presence of a particular pathogen at all  but also is often used in a sense implying a clinically apparent infection .  This fact occasionally creates some ambiguity or prompts some usage discussion; to get around this it is common for health professionals to speak of colonization  when they mean that some of the pathogens are present but that no clinically apparent infection  is present. Different terms are used to describe how and where infections present over time.  In an acute infection, symptoms develop rapidly; its course can either be rapid or protracted.  In chronic infection, symptoms usually develop gradually over weeks or months and are slow to resolve.  In subacute infections, symptoms take longer to develop than in acute infections but arise more quickly than those of chronic infections Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
