Migraine Migraine  This genetic relationship is stronger for migraine with aura than for migraines without aura.  A number of specific variants of genes increase the risk by a small to moderate amount. Single gene disorders that result in migraines are rare.  One of these is known as familial hemiplegic migraine, a type of migraine with aura, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.  Four genes have been shown to be involved in familial hemiplegic migraine.  Three of these genes are involved in ion transport.  The fourth is an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex Migraine Migraine
