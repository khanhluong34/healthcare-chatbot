Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Anton van Leeuwenhoek  advanced the science of microscopy by being the first to observe microorganisms, allowing for easy visualization of bacteria. In the mid-19th century John Snow and William Budd did important work demonstrating the contagiousness of typhoid and cholera through contaminated water.  Both are credited with decreasing epidemics of cholera in their towns by implementing measures to prevent contamination of water.  Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases are caused by infectious agents, and developed a vaccine for rabies.  Robert Koch provided the study of infectious diseases with a scientific basis known as Koch's postulates.  Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin developed effective vaccines for smallpox and polio, which would later result in the eradication and near-eradication of these diseases, respectively.  Alexander Fleming discovered the world's first antibiotic, penicillin, which Florey and Chain then developed Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
