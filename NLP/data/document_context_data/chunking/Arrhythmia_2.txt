Arrhythmia Arrhythmia Many arrhythmias can be effectively treated.  Treatments may include medications, medical procedures such as inserting a pacemaker, and surgery.  Medications for a fast heart rate may include beta blockers, or antiarrhythmic agents such as procainamide, which attempt to restore a normal heart rhythm.  This latter group may have more significant side effects, especially if taken for a long period of time.  Pacemakers are often used for slow heart rates.  Those with an irregular heartbeat are often treated with blood thinners to reduce the risk of complications.  Those who have severe symptoms from an arrhythmia or are medically unstable may receive urgent treatment with a controlled electric shock in the form of cardioversion or defibrillation Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
