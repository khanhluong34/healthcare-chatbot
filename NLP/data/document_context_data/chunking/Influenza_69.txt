Influenza Influenza  Likewise, ICV primarily infects humans but has been observed in pigs, dogs, cattle, and dromedary camels.  IDV causes an influenza-like illness in pigs but its impact in its natural reservoir, cattle, is relatively unknown.  It may cause respiratory disease resembling human influenza on its own, or it may be part of a bovine respiratory disease  complex with other pathogens during co-infection.  BRD is a concern for the cattle industry, so IDV's possible involvement in BRD has led to research on vaccines for cattle that can provide protection against IDV.  Two antigenic lineages are in circulation: D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011  and D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 .  Influenza Influenza
