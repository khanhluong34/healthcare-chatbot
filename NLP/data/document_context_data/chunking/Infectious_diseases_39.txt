Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  when they have been infected previously.  However, it also has become clear that there are genetic factor which determine susceptibility to infection.  For instance, up to 40% of SARS-CoV-2 infections may be asymptomatic, suggesting that many people are naturally protected from disease.  Large genetic studies have defined risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and genome sequences from 659 patients with severe COVID-19 revealed genetic variants that appear to be associated with life-threatening disease.  One gene identified in these studies is type I interferon .  Autoantibodies against type I IFNs were found in up to 13. 7% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19, indicating that a complex interaction between genetics and the immune system is important for natural resistance to Covid Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
