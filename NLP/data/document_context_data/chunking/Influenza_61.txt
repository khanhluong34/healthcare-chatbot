Influenza Influenza  Notable HPAI viruses include HPAI H5N1 and HPAI H7N9.  HPAI viruses have been a major disease burden in the 21st century, resulting in the death of large numbers of birds.  In H7N9's case, some circulating strains were originally LPAI but became HPAI by acquiring the HA multibasic cleavage site.  Avian H9N2 is also of concern because although it is LPAI, it is a common donor of genes to H5N1 and H7N9 during reassortment. Migratory birds can spread influenza across long distances.  An example of this was when an H5N1 strain in 2005 infected birds at Qinghai Lake, China, which is a stopover and breeding site for many migratory birds, subsequently spreading the virus to more than 20 countries across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.  AIVs can be transmitted from wild birds to domestic free-range ducks and in turn to poultry through contaminated water, aerosols, and fomites Influenza Influenza
