Diabetes Diabetes When glucose concentration in the blood remains high over time, the kidneys reach a threshold of reabsorption, and the body excretes glucose in the urine .  This increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production  and increased fluid loss.  Lost blood volume is replaced osmotically from water in body cells and other body compartments, causing dehydration and increased thirst .
