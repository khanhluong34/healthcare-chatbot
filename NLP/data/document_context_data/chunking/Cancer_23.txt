Cancer Cancer  Men of Asian ancestry, with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide, have the lowest levels of prostate cancer. Other factors are relevant: obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers.

There is an association between celiac disease and an increased risk of all cancers Cancer Cancer
