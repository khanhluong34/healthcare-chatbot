Meningitis Meningitis  This risk is much lower in older children, whose mortality is about 2%, but rises again to about 19–37% in adults. Risk of death is predicted by various factors apart from age, such as the pathogen and the time it takes for the pathogen to be cleared from the cerebrospinal fluid, the severity of the generalized illness, a decreased level of consciousness or an abnormally low count of white blood cells in the CSF.  Meningitis caused by H.  influenzae and meningococci has a better prognosis than cases caused by group B streptococci, coliforms and S.  pneumoniae.  In adults, too, meningococcal meningitis has a lower mortality  than pneumococcal disease. In children there are several potential disabilities which may result from damage to the nervous system, including sensorineural hearing loss, epilepsy, learning and behavioral difficulties, as well as decreased intelligence Meningitis Meningitis
