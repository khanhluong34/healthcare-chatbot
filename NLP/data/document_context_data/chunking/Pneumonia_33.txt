Pneumonia Pneumonia Pneumonia can cause severe illness in a number of ways, and pneumonia with evidence of organ dysfunction may require intensive care unit admission for observation and specific treatment.  The main impact is on the respiratory and the circulatory system.  Respiratory failure not responding to normal oxygen therapy may require heated humidified high-flow therapy delivered through nasal cannulae, non-invasive ventilation, or in severe cases mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube.  Regarding circulatory problems as part of sepsis, evidence of poor blood flow or low blood pressure is initially treated with 30 mL/kg of crystalloid infused intravenously.  In situations where fluids alone are ineffective, vasopressor medication may be required. For adults with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome  undergoing mechanical ventilation, there is a reduction in mortality when people lie on their front for at least 12 hours a day.  However, this increases the risk of endotracheal tube obstruction and pressure sores Pneumonia Pneumonia
