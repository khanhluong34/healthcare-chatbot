Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease Overall, the current body of scientific evidence is uncertain on whether intermittent fasting could prevent cardiovascular disease.  Intermittent fasting may help people lose more weight than regular eating patterns, but was not different from energy restriction diets. Blood pressure medication reduces cardiovascular disease in people at risk, irrespective of age, the baseline level of cardiovascular risk, or baseline blood pressure.  The commonly-used drug regimens have similar efficacy in reducing the risk of all major cardiovascular events, although there may be differences between drugs in their ability to prevent specific outcomes.  Larger reductions in blood pressure produce larger reductions in risk, and most people with high blood pressure require more than one drug to achieve adequate reduction in blood pressure.  Adherence to medications is often poor, and while mobile phone text messaging has been tried to improve adherence, there is insufficient evidence that it alters secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins are effective in preventing further cardiovascular disease in people with a history of cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
