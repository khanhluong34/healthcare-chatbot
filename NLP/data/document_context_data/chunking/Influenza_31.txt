Influenza Influenza  Common ways of collecting samples for testing include nasal and throat swabs.  Samples may be taken from the lower respiratory tract if infection has cleared the upper but not lower respiratory tract.  Influenza testing is recommended for anyone hospitalized with symptoms resembling influenza during flu season or who is connected to an influenza case.  For severe cases, earlier diagnosis improves patient outcome.  Diagnostic methods that can identify influenza include viral cultures, antibody- and antigen-detecting tests, and nucleic acid-based tests. Viruses can be grown in a culture of mammalian cells or embryonated eggs for 3â€“10 days to monitor cytopathic effect.  Final confirmation can then be done via antibody staining, hemadsorption using red blood cells, or immunofluorescence microscopy Influenza Influenza
