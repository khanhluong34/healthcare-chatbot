Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease It is estimated that 60% of the world's cardiovascular disease burden will occur in the South Asian subcontinent despite only accounting for 20% of the world's population.  This may be secondary to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors.  Organizations such as the Indian Heart Association are working with the World Heart Federation to raise awareness about this issue. There is evidence that cardiovascular disease existed in pre-history, and research into cardiovascular disease dates from at least the 18th century.   The causes, prevention, and/or treatment of all forms of cardiovascular disease remain active fields of biomedical research, with hundreds of scientific studies being published on a weekly basis. Recent areas of research include the link between inflammation and atherosclerosis  the potential for novel therapeutic interventions, and the genetics of coronary heart disease.
