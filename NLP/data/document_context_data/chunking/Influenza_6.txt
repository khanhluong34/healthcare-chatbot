Influenza Influenza  They are:IAV is responsible for most cases of severe illness as well as seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics.  It infects people of all ages but tends to disproportionately cause severe illness in the elderly, the very young, and those who have chronic health issues.  Birds are the primary reservoir of IAV, especially aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls, but the virus also circulates among mammals, including pigs, horses, and marine mammals.  IAV is classified into subtypes based on the viral proteins haemagglutinin  and neuraminidase .  As of 2019, 18 H subtypes and 11 N subtypes have been identified.  Most potential combinations have been reported in birds, but H17-18 and N10-11 have only been found in bats.  Only H subtypes H1-3 and N subtypes N1-2 are known to have circulated in humans Influenza Influenza
