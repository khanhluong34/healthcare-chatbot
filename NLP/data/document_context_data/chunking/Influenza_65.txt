Influenza Influenza  Prevention and control measures include inactivated vaccines and culling infected herds.  The influenza viruses usually responsible for swine flu are IAV subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. Some IAVs can be transmitted via aerosols from pigs to humans and vice versa.  Furthermore, pigs, along with bats and quails, are recognized as a mixing vessel of influenza viruses because they have both α-2,3 and α-2,6 sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tract.  Because of that, both avian and mammalian influenza viruses can infect pigs.  If co-infection occurs, then reassortment is possible.  A notable example of this was the reassortment of a swine, avian, and human influenza virus in 2009, resulting in a novel H1N1 strain that caused the 2009 flu pandemic Influenza Influenza
