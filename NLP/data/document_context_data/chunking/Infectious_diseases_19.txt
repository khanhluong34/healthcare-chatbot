Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism's immune system that are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus. Instrumentation can be used to read extremely small signals created by secondary reactions linked to the antibody â€“ antigen binding.  Instrumentation can control sampling, reagent use, reaction times, signal detection, calculation of results, and data management to yield a cost-effective automated process for diagnosis of infectious disease. Technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction  method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future, for several reasons.  First, the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified.  Second, an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease.  This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
