Cancer Cancer In the United States and some other cultures, cancer is regarded as a disease that must be "fought" to end the "civil insurrection"; a War on Cancer was declared in the US.  Military metaphors are particularly common in descriptions of cancer's human effects, and they emphasize both the state of the patient's health and the need to take immediate, decisive actions himself rather than to delay, to ignore or to rely entirely on others.  The military metaphors also help rationalize radical, destructive treatments. In the 1970s, a relatively popular alternative cancer treatment in the US was a specialized form of talk therapy, based on the idea that cancer was caused by a bad attitude.  People with a "cancer personality"—depressed, repressed, self-loathing and afraid to express their emotions—were believed to have manifested cancer through subconscious desire.  Some psychotherapists said that treatment to change the patient's outlook on life would cure the cancer.  Among other effects, this belief allowed society to blame the victim for having caused the cancer  or having prevented its cure  Cancer Cancer
