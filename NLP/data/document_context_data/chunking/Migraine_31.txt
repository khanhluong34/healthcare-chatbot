Migraine Migraine  The adverse effects associated with rectal administration have not been well studied.  Some people may find that they respond to one type of sumatriptan better than another. Most side effects are mild, including flushing; however, rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred.  They are thus not recommended for people with cardiovascular disease, who have had a stroke, or have migraines that are accompanied by neurological problems.  In addition, triptans should be prescribed with caution for those with risk factors for vascular disease.  While historically not recommended in those with basilar migraines there is no specific evidence of harm from their use in this population to support this caution.  Triptans are not addictive, but may cause medication-overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month Migraine Migraine
