Meningitis Meningitis  Microbiological culture of the sample is more sensitive  but results can take up to 48 hours to become available.  The type of white blood cell predominantly present  indicates whether meningitis is bacterial  or viral , although at the beginning of the disease this is not always a reliable indicator.  Less commonly, eosinophils predominate, suggesting parasitic or fungal etiology, among others. The concentration of glucose in CSF is normally above 40% of that in blood.  In bacterial meningitis it is typically lower; the CSF glucose level is therefore divided by the blood glucose .  A ratio ≤0. 4 is indicative of bacterial meningitis; in the newborn, glucose levels in CSF are normally higher, and a ratio below 0 Meningitis Meningitis
