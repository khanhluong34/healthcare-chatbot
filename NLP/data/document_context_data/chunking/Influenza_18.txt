Influenza Influenza  Pigs, bats, and quails have receptors for both mammalian and avian IAVs, so they are potential "mixing vessels" for reassortment.  If an animal strain reassorts with a human strain, then a novel strain can emerge that is capable of human-to-human transmission.  This has caused pandemics, but only a limited number have occurred, so it is difficult to predict when the next will happen. People who are infected can transmit influenza viruses through breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing, which spread respiratory droplets and aerosols that contain virus particles into the air.  A person susceptible to infection can then contract influenza by coming into contact with these particles.  Respiratory droplets are relatively large and travel less than two meters before falling onto nearby surfaces.  Aerosols are smaller and remain suspended in the air longer, so they take longer to settle and can travel further than respiratory droplets Influenza Influenza
