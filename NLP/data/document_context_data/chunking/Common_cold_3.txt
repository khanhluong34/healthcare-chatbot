Common cold Common cold The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite.  A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases, a cough in about 50%, and muscle ache likewise in about 50%.  In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children.  The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza.  While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions.  A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections. The color of the mucus or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection Common cold Common cold
