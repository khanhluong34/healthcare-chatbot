Influenza Influenza The microbial agent responsible for influenza was incorrently identified in 1892 by R.  F.  J.  Pfeiffer as the bacteria species Haemophilus influenzae, which retains "influenza" in its name.  In succeeding years, the field of virology began to form as viruses were identified as the cause of many diseases.  From 1901 to 1903, Italian and Austrian researchers were able to show that avian influenza, then called "fowl plague", was caused by a microscopic agent smaller than bacteria by using filters with pores too small for bacteria to pass through.  The fundamental differences between viruses and bacteria, however, were not yet fully understood Influenza Influenza
