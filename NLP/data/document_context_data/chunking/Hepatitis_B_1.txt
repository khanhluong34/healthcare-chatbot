Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  The likelihood of developing chronic hepatitis B is higher for those who are infected with HBV at a younger age.  About 90% of those infected during or shortly after birth develop chronic hepatitis B, while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five develop chronic cases.  Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer eventually develop in about 25% of those with chronic HBV. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids.  In areas where the disease is common, infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood are the most frequent methods by which hepatitis B is acquired.  In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection.  Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries with high infection rates, and living in an institution Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
