Pneumonia Pneumonia  For pneumonia that is associated with a ventilator caused by non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli , a shorter course of antibiotics increases the risk that the pneumonia will return.  Recommendations for hospital-acquired pneumonia include third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin.  These antibiotics are often given intravenously and used in combination.  In those treated in hospital, more than 90% improve with the initial antibiotics.  For people with ventilator-acquired pneumonia, the choice of antibiotic therapy will depend on the person's risk of being infected with a strain of bacteria that is multi-drug resistant.  Once clinically stable, intravenous antibiotics should be switched to oral antibiotics.  For those with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  or Legionella infections, prolonged antibiotics may be beneficial Pneumonia Pneumonia
