Pneumonia Pneumonia Pneumonia frequently starts as an upper respiratory tract infection that moves into the lower respiratory tract.  It is a type of pneumonitis .  The normal flora of the upper airway give protection by competing with pathogens for nutrients.  In the lower airways, reflexes of the glottis, actions of complement proteins and immunoglobulins are important for protection.  Microaspiration of contaminated secretions can infect the lower airways and cause pneumonia.  The progress of pneumonia is determined by the virulence of the organism; the amount of organism required to start an infection; and the body's immune response against the infection. Most bacteria enter the lungs via small aspirations of organisms residing in the throat or nose Pneumonia Pneumonia
