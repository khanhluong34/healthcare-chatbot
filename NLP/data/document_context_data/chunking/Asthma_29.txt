Asthma Asthma  Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms.  Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.  The medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms, however "real world" use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated.  People with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work  or because individuals are either unable  or unwilling  to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications .  In practice, it is not possible to distinguish "refractory" from "difficult to treat" categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications.  A related issue is that the asthma efficacy trials upon which the pharmacological treatment guidelines are based have systematically excluded the majority of people with asthma.  For example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking blunts the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management Asthma Asthma
