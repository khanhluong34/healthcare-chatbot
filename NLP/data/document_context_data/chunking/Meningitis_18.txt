Meningitis Meningitis  When this has been achieved, the "opening pressure" of the CSF is measured using a manometer.  The pressure is normally between 6 and 18 cm water ; in bacterial meningitis the pressure is usually elevated.  In cryptococcal meningitis, intracranial pressure is markedly elevated.   The initial appearance of the fluid may prove an indication of the nature of the infection: cloudy CSF indicates higher levels of protein, white and red blood cells and/or bacteria, and therefore may suggest bacterial meningitis. The CSF sample is examined for presence and types of white blood cells, red blood cells, protein content and glucose level.  Gram staining of the sample may demonstrate bacteria in bacterial meningitis, but absence of bacteria does not exclude bacterial meningitis as they are only seen in 60% of cases; this figure is reduced by a further 20% if antibiotics were administered before the sample was taken.  Gram staining is also less reliable in particular infections such as listeriosis Meningitis Meningitis
