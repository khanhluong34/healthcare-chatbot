Arrhythmia Arrhythmia Arrhythmias, also known as cardiac arrhythmias, heart arrhythmias, or dysrhythmias, are irregularities in the heartbeat, including when it is too fast or too slow.  A resting heart rate that is too fast – above 100 beats per minute in adults – is called tachycardia, and a resting heart rate that is too slow – below 60 beats per minute – is called bradycardia.  Some types of arrhythmias have no symptoms.  Symptoms, when present, may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats.  In more serious cases, there may be lightheadedness, passing out, shortness of breath or chest pain.  While most cases of arrhythmia are not serious, some predispose a person to complications such as stroke or heart failure.  Others may result in sudden death Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
