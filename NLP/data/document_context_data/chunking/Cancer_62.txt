Cancer Cancer  With the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' spread from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites .  This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874. Although many diseases  may have a worse prognosis than most cases of cancer, cancer is the subject of widespread fear and taboos.  The euphemism of "a long illness" to describe cancers leading to death is still commonly used in obituaries, rather than naming the disease explicitly, reflecting an apparent stigma.  Cancer is also euphemised as "the C-word"; Macmillan Cancer Support uses the term to try to lessen the fear around the disease.  In Nigeria, one local name for cancer translates into English as "the disease that cannot be cured".  This deep belief that cancer is necessarily a difficult and usually deadly disease is reflected in the systems chosen by society to compile cancer statistics: the most common form of cancer—non-melanoma skin cancers, accounting for about one-third of cancer cases worldwide, but very few deaths—are excluded from cancer statistics specifically because they are easily treated and almost always cured, often in a single, short, outpatient procedure Cancer Cancer
