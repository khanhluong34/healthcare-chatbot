Hepatitis Hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis can present anywhere within the spectrum from asymptomatic to acute or chronic hepatitis to fulminant liver failure.  Patients are asymptomatic 25â€“34% of the time, and the diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests.  Some studies show between 25% and 75% of cases present with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis.  As with other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune hepatitis usually affects young females , and patients can exhibit classic signs and symptoms of autoimmunity such as fatigue, anemia, anorexia, amenorrhea, acne, arthritis, pleurisy, thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis, nephritis, and maculopapular rash.  Autoimmune hepatitis increases the risk for cirrhosis, and the risk for liver cancer is increased by about 1% for each year of the disease. Many people with autoimmune hepatitis have other autoimmune diseases.  Autoimmune hepatitis is distinct from the other autoimmune diseases of the liver, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, both of which can also lead to scarring, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver Hepatitis Hepatitis
