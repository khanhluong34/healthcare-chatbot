Cancer Cancer  Viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but cancer bacteria and parasites may also play a role. Oncoviruses  include human papillomavirus , Epsteinâ€“Barr virus , Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus , hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses  and human T-cell leukemia virus-1 .  Bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer, as seen in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma.  Parasitic infections associated with cancer include Schistosoma haematobium  and the liver flukes, Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis . Radiation exposure such as ultraviolet radiation and radioactive material is a risk factor for cancer.  Many non-melanoma skin cancers are due to ultraviolet radiation, mostly from sunlight.  Sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging and radon gas Cancer Cancer
