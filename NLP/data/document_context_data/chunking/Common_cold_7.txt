Common cold Common cold  The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined.  Possible explanations may include cold temperature-induced changes in the respiratory system, decreased immune response, and low humidity causing an increase in viral transmission rates, perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer. The apparent seasonality may also be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school.  Although normal exposure to cold does not increase one's risk of infection, severe exposure leading to significant reduction of body temperature  may put one at a greater risk for the common cold; although controversial, the majority of evidence suggests that it may increase susceptibility to infection. Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections.  Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease.  Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function Common cold Common cold
