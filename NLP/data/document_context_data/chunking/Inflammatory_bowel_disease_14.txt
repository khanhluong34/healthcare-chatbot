Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease Gastrointestinal bleeding, occurring especially during ulcerative colitis relapse, can contribute to anaemia when chronic, and may be life-threatening when acute.  To limit the possible risk of dietary intake disturbing hemostasis in acute gastrointestinal bleeding, temporary fasting is often considered necessary in hospital settings.  The effectiveness of this approach is unknown; a Cochrane review in 2016 found no published clinical trials including children. There is preliminary evidence of an infectious contribution to inflammatory bowel disease in some patients that may benefit from antibiotic therapy, such as with rifaximin.  The evidence for a benefit of rifaximin is mostly limited to Crohn's disease with less convincing evidence supporting use in ulcerative colitis. The use of oral probiotic supplements to modify the composition and behaviour of the microbiome has been considered as a possible therapy for both induction and maintenance of remission in people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  A Cochrane review in 2020 did not find clear evidence of improved remission likelihood, nor lower adverse events, in people with Crohn's disease, following probiotic treatment Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
