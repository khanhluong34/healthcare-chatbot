Cancer Cancer  Tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Tobacco is responsible for about one in five cancer deaths worldwide and about one in three in the developed world.  Lung cancer death rates in the United States have mirrored smoking patterns, with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and, more recently, decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990. In Western Europe, 10% of cancers in males and 3% of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol exposure, especially liver and digestive tract cancers.  Cancer from work-related substance exposures may cause between 2 and 20% of cases, causing at least 200,000 deaths.

Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid , which is predominantly used in the production of Teflon, is known to cause two kinds of cancer Cancer Cancer
