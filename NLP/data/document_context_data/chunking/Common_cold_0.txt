Signs and symptoms may appear fewer than two days after exposure to the virus.  These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever.  People usually recover in seven to ten days, but some symptoms may last up to three weeks.  Occasionally, those with other health problems may develop pneumonia. Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses being the most common.  They spread through the air during close contact with infected people or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment, followed by transfer to the mouth or nose Common cold Common cold
