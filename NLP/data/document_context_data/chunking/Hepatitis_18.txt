Hepatitis Hepatitis  Structural abnormalities such as biliary atresia and choledochal cysts can lead to cholestatic liver injury leading to neonatal hepatitis.  Metabolic diseases such as glycogen storage disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also implicated.  Neonatal hepatitis can be idiopathic, and in such cases, biopsy often shows large multinucleated cells in the liver tissue.  This disease is termed giant cell hepatitis and may be associated with viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and drug toxicity. The specific mechanism varies and depends on the underlying cause of the hepatitis.  Generally, there is an initial insult that causes liver injury and activation of an inflammatory response, which can become chronic, leading to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. The pathway by which hepatic viruses cause viral hepatitis is best understood in the case of hepatitis B and C Hepatitis Hepatitis
