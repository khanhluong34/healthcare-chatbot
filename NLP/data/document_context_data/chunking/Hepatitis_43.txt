Hepatitis Hepatitis Hepatitis A is found throughout the world and manifests as large outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water and food sources.  Hepatitis A viral infection is predominant in children ages 5â€“14 with rare infection of infants.  Infected children have little to no apparent clinical illness, in contrast to adults in whom greater than 80% are symptomatic if infected.  Infection rates are highest in low resource countries with inadequate public sanitation and large concentrated populations.   In such regions, as much as 90% of children younger than 10 years old have been infected and are immune, corresponding both to lower rates of clinically symptomatic disease and outbreaks.  The availability of a childhood vaccine has significantly reduced infections in the United States, with incidence declining by more than 95% as of 2013.  Paradoxically, the highest rates of new infection now occur in young adults and adults who present with worse clinical illness Hepatitis Hepatitis
