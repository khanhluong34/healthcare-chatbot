Arrhythmia Arrhythmia   Examples include a higher risk of blood clotting within the heart and a higher risk of insufficient blood being transported to the heart because of a weak heartbeat.  Other increased risks are of embolization and stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. If an arrhythmia results in a heartbeat that is too fast, too slow, or too weak to supply the body's needs, this manifests as lower blood pressure and may cause lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope or brain death due to insufficient supply of blood to the brain. Some types of arrhythmia result in cardiac arrest, or sudden death. Medical assessment of the abnormality using an electrocardiogram is one way to diagnose and assess the risk of any given arrhythmia. Cardiac arrhythmia are caused by one of two major mechanism.   The first of arrhythmia is a result of enhanced or abnormal impulse formation originating at the pacemaker or the His-Purkinje network Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
