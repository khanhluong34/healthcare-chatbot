Hepatitis E Hepatitis E  Transfusion transmission of hepatitis E virus can be screened via minipool HEV NAT  screening.  NAT is a technique used to screen blood molecularly, when blood donations are received; it screens for TTI. A vaccine based on recombinant viral proteins was developed in the 1990s and tested in a high-risk population  in 2001.  The vaccine appeared to be effective and safe, but development was stopped for lack of profitability, since hepatitis E is rare in developed countries.  No hepatitis E vaccine is licensed for use in the United States. The exception is China; after more than a year of scrutiny and inspection by China's State Food and Drug Administration , a hepatitis E vaccine developed by Chinese scientists was available at the end of 2012.  The vaccine—called HEV 239 by its developer Xiamen Innovax Biotech—was approved for prevention of hepatitis E in 2012 by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, following a controlled trial on 100,000+ people from Jiangsu Province where none of those vaccinated became infected during a 12-month period, compared to 15 in the group given placebo Hepatitis E Hepatitis E
