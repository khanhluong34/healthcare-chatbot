Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease  Dietary interventions, including certain exclusion diets like the specific carbohydrate diet  can be beneficial for symptom management.  Dietary fiber interventions, such as psyillium supplementation , may relieve symptoms as well as induce/maintain remission by altering the microbiome composition of the GI tract, thereby improving regulation of immune function, reducing inflammation, and helping to restore the intestinal mucosal lining. Anaemia is commonly present in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.  Due to raised levels of inflammatory cytokines which lead to the increased expression of hepcidin, parenteral iron is the preferred treatment option as it bypasses the gastrointestinal system, has lower incidence of adverse events and enables quicker treatment.  Hepcidin itself is also an anti-inflammatory agent.  In the murine model very low levels of iron restrict hepcidin synthesis, worsening the inflammation that is present.  Enteral nutrition has been found to be efficient to improve hemoglobin level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially combined with erythropoietin Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
