Hepatitis C Hepatitis C  It may be found in people with anti-hepatitis-C antibodies but with normal serum levels of liver enzymes; in antibody-negative people with ongoing elevated liver enzymes of unknown cause; in healthy populations without evidence of liver disease; and in groups at risk for HCV infection including those on hemodialysis or family members of people with occult HCV.  The clinical relevance of this form of infection is under investigation.  The consequences of occult infection appear to be less severe than with chronic infection but can vary from minimal to hepatocellular carcinoma. The rate of occult infection in those apparently cured is controversial but appears to be low.  40% of those with hepatitis but with both negative hepatitis C serology and the absence of detectable viral genome in the serum have hepatitis C virus in the liver on biopsy.  How commonly this occurs in children is unknown. The hepatitis C virus  is a small, enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
