Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease   Therapeutic radiation increases the risk of a subsequent heart attack or stroke by 1. 5 to 4 times; the increase depends on the dose strength, volume, and location. Side-effects from radiation therapy for cardiovascular diseases have been termed radiation-induced heart disease or radiation-induced vascular disease.  Symptoms are dose-dependent and include cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, heart arrhythmia and peripheral artery disease.  Radiation-induced fibrosis, vascular cell damage and oxidative stress can lead to these and other late side-effect symptoms. Population-based studies show that atherosclerosis, the major precursor of cardiovascular disease, begins in childhood.  The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth  study demonstrated that intimal lesions appear in all the aortas and more than half of the right coronary arteries of youths aged 7â€“9 years Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
