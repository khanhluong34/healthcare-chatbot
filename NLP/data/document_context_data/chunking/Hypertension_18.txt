Hypertension Hypertension  A chest X-ray or an echocardiogram may also be performed to look for signs of heart enlargement or damage to the heart. In people aged 18 years or older, hypertension is defined as either a systolic or a diastolic blood pressure measurement consistently higher than an accepted normal value .  Other thresholds are used  if measurements are derived from 24-hour ambulatory or home monitoring.  International hypertension guidelines have also created categories below the hypertensive range to indicate a continuum of risk with higher blood pressures in the normal range.  The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure  published in 2003 uses the term prehypertension for blood pressure in the range 120–139 mmHg systolic or 80–89 mmHg diastolic, while European Society of Hypertension Guidelines  and British Hypertension Society  IV  use optimal, normal and high normal categories to subdivide pressures below 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic.  Hypertension is also sub-classified: JNC7 distinguishes hypertension stage I, hypertension stage II, and isolated systolic hypertension.  Isolated systolic hypertension refers to elevated systolic pressure with normal diastolic pressure and is common in the elderly Hypertension Hypertension
