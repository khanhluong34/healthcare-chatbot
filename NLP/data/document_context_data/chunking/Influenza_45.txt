Influenza Influenza  Depending on the level of pre-existing immunity in the population, novel influenza viruses can spread rapidly and cause pandemics with millions of deaths.  These pandemics, in contrast to seasonal influenza, are caused by antigenic shifts involving animal influenza viruses.  To date, all known flu pandemics have been caused by IAVs, and they follow the same pattern of spreading from an origin point to the rest of the world over the course of multiple waves in a year.  Pandemic strains tend to be associated with higher rates of pneumonia in otherwise healthy individuals.  Generally after each influenza pandemic, the pandemic strain continues to circulate as the cause of seasonal influenza, replacing prior strains.  From 1700 to 1889, influenza pandemics occurred about once every 50–60 years.  Since then, pandemics have occurred about once every 10–50 years, so they may be getting more frequent over time Influenza Influenza
