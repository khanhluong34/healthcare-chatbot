Influenza Influenza  Aquatic birds are the primary source of Influenza A virus , which is also widespread in various mammals, including humans and pigs.  Influenza B virus  and Influenza C virus  primarily infect humans, and Influenza D virus  is found in cattle and pigs.  IAV and IBV circulate in humans and cause seasonal epidemics, and ICV causes a mild infection, primarily in children.  IDV can infect humans but is not known to cause illness.  In humans, influenza viruses are primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets produced from coughing and sneezing.  Transmission through aerosols and intermediate objects and surfaces contaminated by the virus  also occur. Frequent hand washing and covering one's mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing reduce transmission Influenza Influenza
