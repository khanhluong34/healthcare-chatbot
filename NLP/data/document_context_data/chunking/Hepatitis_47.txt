Hepatitis Hepatitis  Most chronic carriers of hepatitis C are unaware of their infection status.  The most common mode of transmission of hepatitis C virus is exposure to blood products via blood transfusions  and intravenous drug injection.  A history of intravenous drug injection is the most important risk factor for chronic hepatitis C.  Other susceptible populations include those engaged in high-risk sexual behavior, infants of infected mothers, and healthcare workers. The hepatitis D virus causes chronic and fulminant hepatitis in the context of co-infection with the hepatitis B virus.  It is primarily transmitted via non-sexual contact and via needles.  Susceptibility to hepatitis D differs by geographic region Hepatitis Hepatitis
