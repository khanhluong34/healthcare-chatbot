Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  However, evidence in 2021 suggests that antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease are harmful, with increased mortality and occurrence of stroke; the use of antibiotics is not supported for preventing secondary coronary heart disease. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation following a heart attack reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and leads to less hospitalizations.  There have been few high-quality studies of the benefits of exercise training in people with increased cardiovascular risk but no history of cardiovascular disease. A systematic review estimated that inactivity is responsible for 6% of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease worldwide.  The authors estimated that 121,000 deaths from coronary heart disease could have been averted in Europe in 2008 if people had not been physically inactive.  Low-quality evidence from a limited number of studies suggest that yoga has beneficial effects on blood pressure and cholesterol.  Tentative evidence suggests that home-based exercise programs may be more efficient at improving exercise adherence Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
