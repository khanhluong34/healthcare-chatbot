Obesity Obesity The correlation between social class and BMI varies globally.  Research in 1989 found that in developed countries women of a high social class were less likely to be obese.  No significant differences were seen among men of different social classes.  In the developing world, women, men, and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity.

Among developed countries, levels of adult obesity, and percentage of teenage children who are overweight, are correlated with income inequality Obesity Obesity
