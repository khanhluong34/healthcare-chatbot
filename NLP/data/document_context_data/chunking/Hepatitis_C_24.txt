Hepatitis C Hepatitis C Cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is a common reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually  recurs afterwards.  Infection of the graft leads to 10â€“30% of people developing cirrhosis within five years.  Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin post-transplant decreases the risk of recurrence to 70%.  A 2013 review found no clear evidence as to whether antiviral medication is useful if the graft became reinfected. Several alternative therapies are claimed by their proponents to be helpful for hepatitis C, including milk thistle, ginseng, and colloidal silver.  However, no alternative therapy has been shown to improve outcomes for hepatitis C patients, and no evidence exists that alternative therapies have any effect on the virus. The responses to treatment is measured by sustained viral response , defined as the absence of detectable RNA of the hepatitis C virus in blood serum for at least 24 weeks after discontinuing treatment, and rapid virological response , defined as undetectable levels achieved within four weeks of treatment Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
