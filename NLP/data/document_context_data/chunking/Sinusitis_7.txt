Sinusitis Sinusitis Sinus infection can spread through anastomosing veins or by direct extension to close structures.  Orbital complications were categorized by Chandler et al.  into five stages according to their severity .  Contiguous spread to the orbit may result in periorbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, orbital cellulitis, and abscess.  Orbital cellulitis can complicate acute ethmoiditis if anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins thrombophlebitis enables the spread of the infection to the lateral or orbital side of the ethmoid labyrinth.  Sinusitis may extend to the central nervous system, where it may cause cavernous sinus thrombosis, retrograde meningitis, and epidural, subdural, and brain abscesses.  Orbital symptoms frequently precede intracranial spread of the infection  Sinusitis Sinusitis
