Non-headache symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell.  The pain is generally made worse by physical activity during an attack, although regular physical exercise may prevent future attacks.

Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following, but not everyone has this symptom. Migraine is believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors Migraine Migraine
