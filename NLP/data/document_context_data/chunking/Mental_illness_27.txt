That means that individuals with one of these disorders were two to three times more likely than the general population to have a partner with a mental disorder.

Thus, people with schizophrenia or ADHD are seven times more likely to have affected partners with the same disorder.  This is even more pronounced for people with Autism spectrum disorders who are 10 times more likely to have a spouse with the same disorder.

Maternal stress and birth complications including prematurity and infections have also been implicated in increasing susceptibility for mental illness Mental illness Mental illness
