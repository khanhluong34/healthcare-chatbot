Hypertension Hypertension  Multiple blood pressure readings  spaced 1â€“2 minutes apart should be obtained to ensure accuracy.  Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over 12 to 24 hours is the most accurate method to confirm the diagnosis.  An exception to this is those with very high blood pressure readings especially when there is poor organ function. With the availability of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitors and home blood pressure machines, the importance of not wrongly diagnosing those who have white coat hypertension has led to a change in protocols.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force also recommends getting measurements outside of the healthcare environment.
