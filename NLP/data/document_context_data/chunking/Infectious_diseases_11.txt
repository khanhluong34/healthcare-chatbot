Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium.  Many pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth, along with copious amounts of water.  A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a "lawn".  The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup , and the environment that supports its growth.  Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification.  Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others.  Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
