Influenza Influenza In 1931, Richard Shope published three papers identifying a virus as the cause of swine influenza, a then newly recognized disease among pigs that was characterized during the second wave of the 1918 pandemic.  Shope's research reinvigorated research on human influenza, and many advances in virology, serology, immunology, experimental animal models, vaccinology, and immunotherapy have since arisen from influenza research.  Just two years after influenza viruses were discovered, in 1933, IAV was identified as the agent responsible for human influenza.  Subtypes of IAV were discovered throughout the 1930s, and IBV was discovered in 1940. During the Second World War, the US government worked on developing inactivated vaccines for influenza, resulting in the first influenza vaccine being licensed in 1945 in the United States.  ICV was discovered two years later in 1947.  In 1955, avian influenza was confirmed to be caused by IAV Influenza Influenza
