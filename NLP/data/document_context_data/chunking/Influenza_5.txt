Influenza Influenza  Pneumonia may be caused by the primary viral infection or by a secondary bacterial infection.  Primary pneumonia is characterized by rapid progression of fever, cough, labored breathing, and low oxygen levels that cause bluish skin.  It is especially common among those who have an underlying cardiovascular disease such as rheumatic heart disease.  Secondary pneumonia typically has a period of improvement in symptoms for 1â€“3 weeks followed by recurrent fever, sputum production, and fluid buildup in the lungs, but can also occur just a few days after influenza symptoms appear.  About a third of primary pneumonia cases are followed by secondary pneumonia, which is most frequently caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Influenza viruses comprise four species.  Each of the four species is the sole member of its own genus, and the four influenza genera comprise four of the seven genera in the family Orthomyxoviridae Influenza Influenza
