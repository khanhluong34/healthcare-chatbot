Influenza Influenza  For example, in late 2016 to early 2017, an avian H7N2 strain was found to be infecting cats in New York. Equine IAVs include H7N7 and two lineages of H3N8.  H7N7, however, has not been detected in horses since the late 1970s, so it may have become extinct in horses.  H3N8 in equines spreads via aerosols and causes respiratory illness.  Equine H3N8 perferentially binds to Î±-2,3 sialic acids, so horses are usually considered dead-end hosts, but transmission to dogs and camels has occurred, raising concerns that horses may be mixing vessels for reassortment.  In canines, the only IAVs in circulation are equine-derived H3N8 and avian-derived H3N2.  Canine H3N8 has not been observed to reassort with other subtypes Influenza Influenza
