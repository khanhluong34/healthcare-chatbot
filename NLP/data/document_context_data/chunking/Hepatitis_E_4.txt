Hepatitis E Hepatitis E HEV is classified into the family Hepeviridae, which is divided in two genera, Orthohepevirus  and Piscihepevirus .  Only one serotype of the human virus is known,  and classification is based on the nucleotide sequences of the genome.  Genotype 1 can be further subclassified into five subtypes, genotype 2 into two subtypes, and genotypes 3 and 4 have been divided into 10 and seven subtypes.  Additionally there are  genotypes 5, 6, 7 and 8.  Rat HEV was first isolated from Norway rats in Germany, and a 2018 CDC article indicated the  detection of rat HEV RNA in a transplant recipient. Genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to humans and often associated with large outbreaks and epidemics in developing countries with poor sanitation conditions.  Genotypes 3 and 4 infect humans, pigs, and other animal species and have been responsible for sporadic cases of hepatitis E in both developing and industrialized countries Hepatitis E Hepatitis E
