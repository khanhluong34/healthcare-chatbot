Back pain Back pain  A 2002 study found that lifestyle factors such as night-shift work and lack of physical activity can also increase the risk of lumbar disc disease. Severe spinal-cord compression is considered a surgical emergency and requires decompression to preserve motor and sensory function.  Cauda equina syndrome involves severe compression of the cauda equina and presents initially with pain followed by motor and sensory.  Bladder incontinence is seen in later stages of cauda equina syndrome. Spondylosis, or degenerative arthritis of the spine, occurs when the intervertebral disc undergoes degenerative changes, causing the disc to fail at cushioning the vertebrae.  There is an association between intervertebral disc space narrowing and lumbar spine pain.  The space between the vertebrae becomes more narrow, resulting in compression and irritation of the nerves Back pain Back pain
