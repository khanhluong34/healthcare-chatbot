Arrhythmia Arrhythmia Although omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil can be protective against arrhythmias, they can facilitate re-entrant arrhythmias. When an entire chamber of the heart is involved in multiple micro-re-entry circuits and is, therefore, quivering with chaotic electrical impulses, it is said to be in fibrillation. Fibrillation can affect the atrium  or the ventricle : ventricular fibrillation is imminently life-threatening. CPR can prolong the survival of the brain in the lack of a normal pulse, but defibrillation is the only intervention that can restore a healthy heart rhythm.  Defibrillation is performed by applying an electric shock to the heart, which resets the cells, permitting a normal beat to re-establish itself. Triggered beats occur when problems at the level of the ion channels in individual heart cells result in abnormal propagation of electrical activity and can lead to a sustained abnormal rhythm.  They are relatively rare and can result from the action of anti-arrhythmic drugs, or after depolarizations Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
