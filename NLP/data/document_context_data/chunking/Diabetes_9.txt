Diabetes Diabetes "Brittle" diabetes, also known as unstable diabetes or labile diabetes, is a term that was traditionally used to describe the dramatic and recurrent swings in glucose levels, often occurring for no apparent reason in insulin-dependent diabetes.  This term, however, has no biologic basis and should not be used.  Still, type 1 diabetes can be accompanied by irregular and unpredictable high blood sugar levels, and the potential for diabetic ketoacidosis or serious low blood sugar levels.  Other complications include an impaired counterregulatory response to low blood sugar, infection, gastroparesis , and endocrinopathies .  These phenomena are believed to occur no more frequently than in 1% to 2% of persons with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is partly inherited, with multiple genes, including certain HLA genotypes, known to influence the risk of diabetes.  In genetically susceptible people, the onset of diabetes can be triggered by one or more environmental factors, such as a viral infection or diet Diabetes Diabetes
