Infectious diseases Infectious diseases Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents.  Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic dyes due to the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye.  A cell is normally transparent under a microscope, and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background.  Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size, shape, internal and external components and its associations with other cells.  The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the taxonomic classification of microbes as well.  Two methods, the Gram stain and the acid-fast stain, are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease.  The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups Bacillota and Actinomycetota, both of which contain many significant human pathogens Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
