Hepatitis E Hepatitis E  ORF3 is proposed to play critical roles in immune evasion by HEV.  Previous studies showed that ORF3 is bound to viral particles found in patient sera and produced in cell culture.  Although in cultured cells ORF3 has not appeared essential for HEV RNA replication, viral assembly, or infection, it is required for particle release. The lifecycle of hepatitis E virus is unknown; the capsid protein obtains viral entry by binding to a cellular receptor.  ORF2  moderates viral entry by binding to HSC70. Geldanamycin blocks the transport of HEV239 capsid protein, but not the binding/entry of the truncated capsid protein, which indicates that Hsp90 plays an important part in HEV transport. In terms of the diagnosis of hepatitis E, only a laboratory blood test that confirms the presence of HEV RNA or IgM antibodies to HEV can be trusted Hepatitis E Hepatitis E
