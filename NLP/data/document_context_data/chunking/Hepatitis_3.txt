Hepatitis Hepatitis  In the United States, hepatitis A is estimated to occur in about 2,500 people a year and results in about 75 deaths.  The word is derived from the Greek hêpar , meaning "liver", and -itis , meaning "inflammation". Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.  The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.  Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ. Acute viral hepatitis follows three distinct phases:Both drug-induced hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis can present very similarly to acute viral hepatitis, with slight variations in symptoms depending on the cause.  Cases of drug-induced hepatitis can manifest with systemic signs of an allergic reaction including rash, fever, serositis , elevated eosinophils , and suppression of bone marrow activity Hepatitis Hepatitis
