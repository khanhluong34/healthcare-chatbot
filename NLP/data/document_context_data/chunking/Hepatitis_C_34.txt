Hepatitis C Hepatitis C 
Because of the unique molecular "isolation" of the Hepatitis C virus, although Houghton and Kuo's team at Chiron had discovered strong biochemical markers for the virus and the test proved effective at reducing cases of post-transfusion hepatitis, the existence of a hepatitis C virus was essentially inferred.  In 1992, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the virus had never been observed under an electron microscope.  In 1997, the American FDA approved the first hepatitis C drug on the basis of a surrogate marker called "Sustained Virological Response. " In response, the pharmaceutical industry established a nationwide network of "Astro-Turf" patient advocacy groups to raise awareness  of the disease. Hepatitis C was finally "discovered" in 2005 when a Japanese team was able to propagate a molecular clone in a cell culture called Huh7.  This discovery enabled proper characterization of the viral particle and rapid research into the development of protease inhibitors replacing early interferon treatments.  The first of these, sofosbuvir, was approved on December 6, 2013 Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
