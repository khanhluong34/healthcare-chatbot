Meningitis Meningitis The large-scale inflammation that occurs in the subarachnoid space during meningitis is not a direct result of bacterial infection but can rather largely be attributed to the response of the immune system to the entry of bacteria into the central nervous system.  When components of the bacterial cell membrane are identified by the immune cells of the brain , they respond by releasing large amounts of cytokines, hormone-like mediators that recruit other immune cells and stimulate other tissues to participate in an immune response.  The bloodâ€“brain barrier becomes more permeable, leading to "vasogenic" cerebral edema .  Large numbers of white blood cells enter the CSF, causing inflammation of the meninges and leading to "interstitial" edema .  In addition, the walls of the blood vessels themselves become inflamed , which leads to decreased blood flow and a third type of edema, "cytotoxic" edema.  The three forms of cerebral edema all lead to increased intracranial pressure; together with the lowered blood pressure often encountered in sepsis, this means that it is harder for blood to enter the brain; consequently brain cells are deprived of oxygen and undergo apoptosis . Administration of antibiotics may initially worsen the process outlined above, by increasing the amount of bacterial cell membrane products released through the destruction of bacteria Meningitis Meningitis
