Mental illness Mental illness  A physical examination to check for ill health or the effects of medications or other drugs may be conducted.  Psychological testing is sometimes used via paper-and-pen or computerized questionnaires, which may include algorithms based on ticking off standardized diagnostic criteria, and in rare specialist cases neuroimaging tests may be requested, but such methods are more commonly found in research studies than routine clinical practice. Time and budgetary constraints often limit practicing psychiatrists from conducting more thorough diagnostic evaluations.  It has been found that most clinicians evaluate patients using an unstructured, open-ended approach, with limited training in evidence-based assessment methods, and that inaccurate diagnosis may be common in routine practice.  In addition, comorbidity is very common in psychiatric diagnosis, where the same person meets the criteria for more than one disorder.  On the other hand, a person may have several different difficulties only some of which meet the criteria for being diagnosed.
