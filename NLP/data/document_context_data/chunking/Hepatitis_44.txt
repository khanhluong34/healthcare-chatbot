Hepatitis Hepatitis  Specific populations at greatest risk include: travelers to endemic regions, men who have sex with men, those with occupational exposure to non-human primates, people with clotting disorders who have received clotting factors, people with history of chronic liver disease in whom co-infection with hepatitis A can lead to fulminant hepatitis, and intravenous drug users . Hepatitis B is the most common cause of viral hepatitis in the world with more than 240 million chronic carriers of the virus, 1 million of whom are in the United States.  In approximately two-thirds of patients who develop acute hepatitis B infection, no identifiable exposure is evident.   Of those acutely infected, 25% become lifetime carriers of the virus.  Risk of infection is highest among intravenous drug users, people with high-risk sexual behaviors, healthcare workers, people who had multiple transfusions, organ transplant patients, dialysis patients and newborns infected during the birthing process.  Close to 780,000 deaths in the world are attributed to hepatitis B.  The most endemic regions are in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, where as many as 10% of adults are chronic carriers Hepatitis Hepatitis
