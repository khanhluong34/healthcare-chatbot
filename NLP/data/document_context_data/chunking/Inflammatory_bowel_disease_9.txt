Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease In 10â€“15% of cases, a definitive diagnosis neither of Crohn's disease nor of ulcerative colitis can be made because of idiosyncrasies in the presentation.  In this case, a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis may be made.  Although a recognised definition, not all centres refer to this. CD and UC are chronic inflammatory diseases, and are not medically curable.  However, Ulcerative Colitis can in most cases be cured by proctocolectomy, although this may not eliminate extra-intestinal symptoms.  An ileostomy will collect feces in a bag.  Alternatively, a pouch can be created from the small intestine; this serves as the rectum and prevents the need for a permanent ileostomy Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
