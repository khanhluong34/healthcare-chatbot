Asthma Asthma  Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from COPD.  It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person's asthma is controlled. The methacholine challenge involves the inhalation of increasing concentrations of a substance that causes airway narrowing in those predisposed.  If negative it means that a person does not have asthma; if positive, however, it is not specific for the disease. Other supportive evidence includes: a ≥20% difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks, a ≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone, or a ≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger.  Testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry, however, and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis.  It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications Asthma Asthma
