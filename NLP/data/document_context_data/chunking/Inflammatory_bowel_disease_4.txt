Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease  Dysfunction of the innate immune system as a result of abnormal signaling through immune receptors called toll-like receptors —which activates an immune response to molecules that are broadly shared by multiple pathogens—contributes to acute and chronic inflammatory processes in IBD colitis and associated cancer.  Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota are an important environmental factor in the development of IBD.  Detrimental changes in the intestinal microbiota induce an inappropriate  immune response that results in damage to the intestinal epithelium.  Breaches in this critical barrier  allow further infiltration of microbiota that, in turn, elicit further immune responses.  IBD is a multifactorial disease that is nonetheless driven in part by an exaggerated immune response to gut microbiota that causes defects in epithelial barrier function. Pereira et al.  reviewed evidence from numerous studies indicating that oxidative stress and DNA damage likely have a role in the pathophysiology of IBD Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
