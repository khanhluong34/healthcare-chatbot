Asthma Asthma  It may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations. Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second , and peak expiratory flow rate.  Asthma may also be classified as atopic  or non-atopic , based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens  or not .  While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system.  Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research. Although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition, it is not considered as a part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as bronchiectasis and emphysema.  Unlike these diseases, the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible; however, if left untreated, the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling Asthma Asthma
