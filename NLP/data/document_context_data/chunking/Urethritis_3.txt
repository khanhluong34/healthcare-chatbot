Urethritis Urethritis  Women will also have abdominal and pelvic exams to check for urethral discharge, and tenderness of the lower abdomen or urethra. In men, urethritis is diagnosed by at least one of the following: mucopurulent or purulent urethral discharge on examination,  ≥ 2 white blood cells per oil immersion field from a Gram stain of a urethral swab, or positive leukocyte esterase and/or ≥10 white blood cells per high power field of the first-void urine.  Men who meet the criteria for urethritis commonly get nucleic acid amplification testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae to determine the type of urethritis.  Men will have an exam on the abdomen, bladder area, penis, and scrotum.  Additionally, a digital rectal examination of the prostate may be used if rectal pain is reported or if the individual is of older age. Primary prevention can be accomplished by the reduction of modifiable risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing urethritis.  These factors include, but are not limited to, sexual intercourse  and genital irritation from contact with tight clothing, physical activity, and various irritants such as soap, lotion and spermicides Urethritis Urethritis
