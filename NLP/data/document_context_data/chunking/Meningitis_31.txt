Meningitis Meningitis Additional treatment with corticosteroids have a different role in children than in adults.  Though the benefit of corticosteroids has been demonstrated in adults as well as in children from high-income countries, their use in children from low-income countries is not supported by the evidence; the reason for this discrepancy is not clear.  Even in high-income countries, the benefit of corticosteroids is only seen when they are given prior to the first dose of antibiotics, and is greatest in cases of H.  influenzae meningitis, the incidence of which has decreased dramatically since the introduction of the Hib vaccine.  Thus, corticosteroids are recommended in the treatment of pediatric meningitis if the cause is H.  influenzae, and only if given prior to the first dose of antibiotics; other uses are controversial. In addition to the primary therapy of antibiotics and corticosteroids, other adjuvant therapies are under development or are sometimes used to try and improve survival from bacterial meningitis and reduce the risk of neurological problems Meningitis Meningitis
