Pneumonia Pneumonia  Pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with rusty colored sputum.  Pneumonia caused by Klebsiella may have bloody sputum often described as "currant jelly".  Bloody sputum  may also occur with tuberculosis, Gram-negative pneumonia, lung abscesses and more commonly acute bronchitis.  Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae may occur in association with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, joint pain, or a middle ear infection.  Viral pneumonia presents more commonly with wheezing than bacterial pneumonia.  Pneumonia was historically divided into "typical" and "atypical" based on the belief that the presentation predicted the underlying cause.  However, evidence has not supported this distinction, therefore it is no longer emphasized Pneumonia Pneumonia
