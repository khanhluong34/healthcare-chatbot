Influenza Influenza  The novel H3N2 strain emerged in Hong Kong and spread worldwide, causing the Hong Kong flu pandemic, which resulted in 500,000â€“2,000,000 deaths.  This was the first pandemic to spread significantly by air travel.  H2N2 and H3N2 co-circulated after the pandemic until 1971 when H2N2 waned in prevalence and was completely replaced by H3N2.  In 1977, H1N1 reemerged in humans, possibly after it was released from a freezer in a laboratory accident, and caused a pseudo-pandemic.  Whether the 1977 "pandemic" deserves to be included in the natural history of flu pandemics is debatable.  This H1N1 strain was antigenically similar to the H1N1 strains that circulated prior to 1957.  Since 1977, both H1N1 and H3N2 have circulated in humans as part of seasonal influenza Influenza Influenza
