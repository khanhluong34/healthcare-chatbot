Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development. Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for paleopathologists, scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms.  Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs.  When present, however, these infections seem to tend to be confined to only small regions of the body.  A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis exhibits pit-like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone.  The unusual texture of the bone around the wounds suggests they were affected by a short-lived, non-lethal infection Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
