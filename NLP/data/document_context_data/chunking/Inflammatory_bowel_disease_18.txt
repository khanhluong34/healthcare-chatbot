Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease Around one-third of individuals with IBD experience persistent gastrointestinal symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome  in the absence of objective evidence of disease activity.  Despite enduring the side-effects of long-term therapies, this cohort has a quality of life that is not significantly different to that of individuals with uncontrolled, objectively active disease, and escalation of therapy to biological agents is typically ineffective in resolving their symptoms.  The cause of these IBS-like symptoms is unclear, but it has been suggested that changes in the gut-brain axis, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and the gut flora may be partially responsible. While patients of IBD do have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, this is usually caught much earlier than the general population in routine surveillance of the colon by colonoscopy, and therefore patients are much more likely to survive. New evidence suggests that patients with IBD may have an elevated risk of endothelial dysfunction and coronary artery disease. The goal of treatment is toward achieving remission, after which the patient is usually switched to a lighter drug with fewer potential side effects.  Every so often, an acute resurgence of the original symptoms may appear; this is known as a "flare-up" Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
