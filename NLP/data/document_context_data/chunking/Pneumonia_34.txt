Pneumonia Pneumonia Antibiotics improve outcomes in those with bacterial pneumonia.  The first dose of antibiotics should be given as soon as possible.  Increased use of antibiotics, however, may lead to the development of antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria.  Antibiotic choice depends initially on the characteristics of the person affected, such as age, underlying health, and the location the infection was acquired.  Antibiotic use is also associated with side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, taste distortion, or headaches.  In the UK, treatment before culture results with amoxicillin is recommended as the first line for community-acquired pneumonia, with doxycycline or clarithromycin as alternatives.  In North America, amoxicillin, doxycycline, and in some areas a macrolide  is the first-line outpatient treatment in adults Pneumonia Pneumonia
