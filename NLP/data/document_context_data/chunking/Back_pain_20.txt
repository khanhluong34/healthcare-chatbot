Back pain Back pain Biomechanical factors of pregnancy shown to be associated with back pain include increased curvature of the lower back, or lumbar lordosis, to support the added weight on the abdomen.  Also, the hormone relaxin is released during pregnancy, which softens the structural tissues in the pelvis and lower back to prepare for vaginal delivery.  This softening and increased flexibility of the ligaments and joints in the lower back can result in pain.  Back pain in pregnancy is often accompanied by radicular symptoms, suggested to be caused by the baby pressing on the sacral plexus and lumbar plexus in the pelvis. Typical factors aggravating the back pain of pregnancy include standing, sitting, forward bending, lifting and walking.
