Asthma Asthma Asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions.  These influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment.  It is believed that the recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics  and a changing living environment.  Asthma that starts before the age of 12 years old is more likely due to genetic influence, while onset after age 12 is more likely due to environmental influence. Many environmental factors have been associated with asthma's development and exacerbation, including, allergens, air pollution, and other environmental chemicals.  There are some substances that are known to cause asthma in exposed people and they are called asthmagens.  Some common asthmagens include ammonia, latex, pesticides, solder and welding fumes, metal or wood dusts, spraying of isocyanate paint in vehicle repair, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, anhydrides, glues, dyes, metal working fluids, oil mists, molds Asthma Asthma
