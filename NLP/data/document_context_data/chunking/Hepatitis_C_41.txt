Hepatitis C Hepatitis C  This is done by generating chimeric mice and exposing the mice to HCV infection.  This engineering process is known to create humanized mice, and provide opportunities to study hepatitis C within the 3D architectural design of the liver and evaluating antiviral compounds.  Alternatively, generating inbred mice with susceptibility to HCV would simplify the process of studying mouse models.  Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
