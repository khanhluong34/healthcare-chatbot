Influenza Influenza  In residential homes, new admissions may need to be closed until the spread of influenza is controlled.  When discharging patients to care homes, it is important to take care if there is a known influenza outbreak. Since influenza viruses circulate in animals such as birds and pigs, prevention of transmission from these animals is important.  Water treatment, indoor raising of animals, quarantining sick animals, vaccination, and biosecurity are the primary measures used.  Placing poultry houses and piggeries on high ground away from high-density farms, backyard farms, live poultry markets, and bodies of water helps to minimize contact with wild birds.  Closure of live poultry markets appears to the most effective measure and has shown to be effective at controlling the spread of H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2.  Other biosecurity measures include cleaning and disinfecting facilities and vehicles, banning visits to poultry farms, not bringing birds intended for slaughter back to farms, changing clothes, disinfecting foot baths, and treating food and water Influenza Influenza
