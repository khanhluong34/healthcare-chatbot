Pneumonia Pneumonia  "The most common pathogens were human rhinovirus , influenza virus , and Streptococcus pneumoniae . "The term pneumonia is sometimes more broadly applied to any condition resulting in inflammation of the lungs ; however, this inflammation is more accurately referred to as pneumonitis. Factors that predispose to pneumonia include smoking, immunodeficiency, alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sickle cell disease , asthma, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and biological aging.  Additional risks in children include not being breastfed, exposure to cigarette smoke and other air pollution, malnutrition, and poverty.  The use of acid-suppressing medications – such as proton-pump inhibitors or H2 blockers – is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia.  Approximately 10% of people who require mechanical ventilation develop ventilator-associated pneumonia, and people with a gastric feeding tube have an increased risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.  Moreover, the misplacement of a feeding tube can lead to aspiration pneumonia Pneumonia Pneumonia
