Diabetes Diabetes Two types of diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400–500 CE with one type being associated with youth and another type with being overweight.  Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Herbert Best isolated and purified insulin in 1921 and 1922.  This was followed by the development of the long-acting insulin NPH in the 1940s. The word diabetes  comes from Latin diabētēs, which in turn comes from Ancient Greek διαβήτης , which literally means "a passer through; a siphon".  Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia  used that word, with the intended meaning "excessive discharge of urine", as the name for the disease.  Ultimately, the word comes from Greek διαβαίνειν , meaning "to pass through", which is composed of δια- , meaning "through" and βαίνειν , meaning "to go".  The word "diabetes" is first recorded in English, in the form diabete, in a medical text written around 1425 Diabetes Diabetes
