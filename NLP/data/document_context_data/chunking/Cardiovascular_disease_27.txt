Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  As the event rate is higher in men than in women, the decrease in events is more easily seen in men than women.  In those at risk, but without a history of cardiovascular disease , statins decrease the risk of death and combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease.  The benefit, however, is small.  A United States guideline recommends statins in those who have a 12% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease over the next ten years.  Niacin, fibrates and CETP Inhibitors, while they may increase HDL cholesterol do not affect the risk of cardiovascular disease in those who are already on statins.  Fibrates lower the risk of cardiovascular and coronary events, but there is no evidence to suggest that they reduce all-cause mortality. Anti-diabetic medication may reduce cardiovascular risk in people with Type 2 diabetes, although evidence is not conclusive Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
