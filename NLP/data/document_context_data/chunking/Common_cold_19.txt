Common cold Common cold  In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed.  The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment in the history of the unit. Antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; as of 2009, none had been both found effective and licensed for use.  There are ongoing trials of the anti-viral drug pleconaril which shows promise against picornaviruses as well as trials of BTA-798.  The oral form of pleconaril had safety issues and an aerosol form is being studied.  Double-stranded RNA activated caspase oligomerizer , a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy, has shown preliminary effectiveness in treating rhinovirus, as well as other infectious viruses. The genomes of all known human rhinovirus strains have been sequenced Common cold Common cold
