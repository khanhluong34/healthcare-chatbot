Sinusitis Sinusitis  Because of increasing resistance to amoxicillin the 2012 guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate as the initial treatment of choice for bacterial sinusitis.  The guidelines also recommend against other commonly used antibiotics, including azithromycin, clarithromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, because of growing antibiotic resistance.  The FDA recommends against the use of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. A short-course  of antibiotics seems to be just as effective as the typical longer-course  of antibiotics for those with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis without any other severe disease or complicating factors.  The IDSA guideline suggest five to seven days of antibiotics is long enough to treat a bacterial infection without encouraging resistance.  The guidelines still recommend children receive antibiotic treatment for ten days to two weeks. For unconfirmed acute sinusitis, nasal sprays using corticosteroids have not been found to be better than a placebo either alone or in combination with antibiotics Sinusitis Sinusitis
