Hypertension Hypertension  A variety of factors, such as gestational age, postconceptional age and birth weight needs to be taken into account when deciding if a blood pressure is normal in a newborn. Hypertension defined as elevated blood pressure over several visits affects 1% to 5% of children and adolescents and is associated with long-term risks of ill-health.  Blood pressure rises with age in childhood and, in children, hypertension is defined as an average systolic or diastolic blood pressure on three or more occasions equal or higher than the 95th percentile appropriate for the sex, age and height of the child.  High blood pressure must be confirmed on repeated visits however before characterizing a child as having hypertension.  Prehypertension in children has been defined as average systolic or diastolic blood pressure that is greater than or equal to the 90th percentile, but less than the 95th percentile.  In adolescents, it has been proposed that hypertension and pre-hypertension are diagnosed and classified using the same criteria as in adults. Much of the disease burden of high blood pressure is experienced by people who are not labeled as hypertensive Hypertension Hypertension
