Influenza Influenza Influenza in pigs is a respiratory disease similar to influenza in humans and is found worldwide.  Asymptomatic infections are common.  Symptoms typically appear 1–3 days after infection and include fever, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, labored breathing, coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge.  In sows, pregnancy may be aborted.  Complications include secondary infections and potentially fatal bronchopneumonia.  Pigs become contagious within a day of infection and typically spread the virus for 7–10 days, which can spread rapidly within a herd.  Pigs usually recover from infection within 3–7 days after symptoms appear Influenza Influenza
