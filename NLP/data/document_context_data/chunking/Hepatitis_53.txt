Hepatitis Hepatitis After such an eruption, the patient soon raves, becomes angry, talks nonsense and barks like a dog. "Given the poor sanitary conditions of war, infectious jaundice played a large role as a major cause of mortality among troops in the Napoleonic Wars, the American Revolutionary War, and both World Wars.  During World War II, estimates of soldiers affected by hepatitis were upwards of 10 million. During World War II, soldiers received vaccines against diseases such as yellow fever, but these vaccines were stabilized with human serum, presumably contaminated with hepatitis viruses, which often created epidemics of hepatitis.  It was suspected these epidemics were due to a separate infectious agent, and not due to the yellow fever virus itself, after noting 89 cases of jaundice in the months after vaccination out of a total 3,100 patients that were vaccinated.   After changing the seed virus strain, no cases of jaundice were observed in the subsequent 8,000 vaccinations. A New York University researcher named Saul Krugman continued this research into the 1950s and 1960s, most infamously with his experiments on mentally disabled children at the Willowbrook State School in New York, a crowded urban facility where hepatitis infections were highly endemic to the student body Hepatitis Hepatitis
