Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  The human strains of Ebola virus, for example, incapacitate those infected extremely quickly and kill them soon after.  As a result, those affected by this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone.  Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye.  Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging.  As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area.  In contrast, the human immunodeficiency virus  kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system.  As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
