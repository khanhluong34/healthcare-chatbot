Cervicitis Cervicitis  If a person with an IUD develops cervicitis, it usually does not need to be removed, if the person wants to continue using it. There are also certain behaviors that can place individuals at a higher risk for contracting cervicitis.  High-risk sexual behavior, a history of STIs, many sexual partners, sex at an early age, and sexual partners who engage in high-risk sexual behavior or have had an STI can increase the likelihood of contracting cervicitis. To diagnose cervicitis, a clinician will perform a pelvic exam.  This exam includes a speculum exam with visual inspection of the cervix for abnormal discharge, which is usually purulent or bleeding from the cervix with little provocation.  Swabs can be used to collect a sample of this discharge for inspection under a microscope and/or lab testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and Trichomonas vaginalis.  A bimanual exam in which the clinician palpates the cervix to see if there is any associated pain should be done to assess for pelvic inflammatory disease Cervicitis Cervicitis
