The largest outbreak of Hepatitis B ever recorded was the infection of up to 330,000 American soldiers during World War II.  The outbreak has been blamed on a yellow fever vaccine made with contaminated human blood serum, and after receiving the vaccinations about 50,000 soldiers developed jaundice. The virus was not discovered until 1966 when Baruch Blumberg, then working at the National Institutes of Health , discovered the Australia antigen  in the blood of Aboriginal Australian people.  Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by Frederick MacCallum in 1947, David Dane and others discovered the virus particle in 1970 by electron microscopy.  In 1971, the FDA issued its first-ever blood supply screening order to blood banks.  By the early 1980s the genome of the virus had been sequenced, and the first vaccines were being tested Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
