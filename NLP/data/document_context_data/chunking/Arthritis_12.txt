Arthritis Arthritis Lupus is a common collagen vascular disorder that can be present with severe arthritis.  Other features of lupus include a skin rash, extreme photosensitivity, hair loss, kidney problems, lung fibrosis and constant joint pain. Gout is caused by deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, causing inflammation.  There is also an uncommon form of gouty arthritis caused by the formation of rhomboid crystals of calcium pyrophosphate known as pseudogout.  In the early stages, the gouty arthritis usually occurs in one joint, but with time, it can occur in many joints and be quite crippling.  The joints in gout can often become swollen and lose function.  Gouty arthritis can become particularly painful and potentially debilitating when gout cannot successfully be treated Arthritis Arthritis
