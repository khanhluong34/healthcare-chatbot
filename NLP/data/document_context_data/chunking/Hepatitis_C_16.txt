Hepatitis C Hepatitis C  HCV is not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating or cooking utensils, nor is it transmitted through food or water. Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C occurs in fewer than 10% of pregnancies.  There are no measures that alter this risk.  It is not clear when transmission occurs during pregnancy, but it may occur both during gestation and at delivery.  A long labor is associated with a greater risk of transmission.  There is no evidence that breastfeeding spreads HCV; however, to be cautious, an infected mother is advised to avoid breastfeeding if her nipples are cracked and bleeding, or if her viral loads are high. There are a number of diagnostic tests for hepatitis C, including HCV antibody enzyme immunoassay , recombinant immunoblot assay, and quantitative HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction  Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
