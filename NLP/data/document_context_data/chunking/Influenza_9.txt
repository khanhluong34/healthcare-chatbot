Influenza Influenza  ICV and IDV experience a slower rate of antigenic evolution than IAV and IBV.  Because of this antigenic stability, relatively few novel lineages emerge. Influenza viruses have a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that is segmented.  The negative sense of the genome means it can be used as a template to synthesize messenger RNA .  IAV and IBV have eight genome segments that encode 10 major proteins.  ICV and IDV have seven genome segments that encode nine major proteins.  Three segments encode three subunits of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  complex: PB1, a transcriptase, PB2, which recognizes 5' caps, and PA , an endonuclease Influenza Influenza
