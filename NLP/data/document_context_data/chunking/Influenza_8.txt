Influenza Influenza  ICV infection primarily affects children and is usually asymptomatic or has mild cold-like symptoms, though more severe symptoms such as gastroenteritis and pneumonia can occur.  Unlike IAV and IBV, ICV has not been a major focus of research pertaining to antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other measures against influenza.  ICV is subclassified into six genetic/antigenic lineages. IDV has been isolated from pigs and cattle, the latter being the natural reservoir.  Infection has also been observed in humans, horses, dromedary camels, and small ruminants such as goats and sheep.  IDV is distantly related to ICV.  While cattle workers have occasionally tested positive to prior IDV infection, it is not known to cause disease in humans Influenza Influenza
