Hypertension Hypertension  Proper blood pressure measurement requires the person whose blood pressure is being measured to sit quietly for at least five minutes which is then followed by application of a properly fitted blood pressure cuff to a bare upper arm.  The person should be seated with their back supported, feet flat on the floor, and with their legs uncrossed.  The person whose blood pressure is being measured should avoid talking or moving during this process.  The arm being measured should be supported on a flat surface at the level of the heart.  Blood pressure measurement should be done in a quiet room so the medical professional checking the blood pressure can hear the Korotkoff sounds while listening to the brachial artery with a stethoscope for accurate blood pressure measurements.  The blood pressure cuff should be deflated slowly  while listening for the Korotkoff sounds.  The bladder should be emptied before a person's blood pressure is measured since this can increase blood pressure by up to 15/10 mmHg Hypertension Hypertension
