Pancreatitis Pancreatitis Diagnosis requires 2 of the 3 following criteria:Amylase and lipase are 2 enzymes produced by the pancreas.  Elevations in lipase are generally considered a better indicator for pancreatitis as it has greater specificity and has a longer half life.  However, both enzymes can be elevated in other disease states.  In chronic pancreatitis, the fecal pancreatic elastase-1  test is a marker of exocrine pancreatic function.  Additional tests that may be useful in evaluating chronic pancreatitis include hemoglobin A1C, immunoglobulin G4, rheumatoid factor, and anti-nuclear antibody. For imaging, abdominal ultrasound is convenient, simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive.  It is more sensitive and specific for pancreatitis from gallstones than other imaging modalities Pancreatitis Pancreatitis
