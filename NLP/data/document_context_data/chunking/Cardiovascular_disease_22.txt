Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  As a result, future preventative screening appears to shift toward applying prevention according to randomized trial results of each intervention rather than large-scale risk assessment. Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.  Currently practised measures to prevent cardiovascular disease include:Most guidelines recommend combining preventive strategies.  There is some evidence that interventions aiming to reduce more than one cardiovascular risk factor may have beneficial effects on blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference; however, evidence was limited and the authors were unable to draw firm conclusions on the effects on cardiovascular events and mortality. There is additional evidence to suggest that providing people with a cardiovascular disease risk score may reduce risk factors by a small amount compared to usual care.  However, there was some uncertainty as to whether providing these scores had any effect on cardiovascular disease events.  It is unclear whether or not dental care in those with periodontitis affects their risk of cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
