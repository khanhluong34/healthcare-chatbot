Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  Currently, airborne particles under 2. 5 micrometers in diameter  are the major focus, in which gradients are used to determine CVD risk.  Overall, long-term PM exposure increased rate of atherosclerosis and inflammation.  In regards to short-term exposure , every 25 μg/m3 of PM2. 5 resulted in a 48% increase of CVD mortality risk.  In addition, after only 5 days of exposure, a rise in systolic  and diastolic  blood pressure occurred for every 10. 5 μg/m3 of PM2 Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
