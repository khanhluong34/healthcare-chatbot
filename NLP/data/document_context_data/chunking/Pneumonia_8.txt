Pneumonia Pneumonia The spreading of organisms is facilitated by certain risk factors.  Alcoholism is associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobic organisms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; smoking facilitates the effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella pneumophila.  Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.  Streptococcus pneumoniae is more common in the winter, and it should be suspected in persons aspirating a large number of anaerobic organisms. In adults, viruses account for about one third of pneumonia cases, and in children for about 15% of them.  Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus , adenovirus, and parainfluenza.  Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns Pneumonia Pneumonia
