Arrhythmia Arrhythmia  Increased heart rate is a normal response to physical exercise or emotional stress.   This is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system on the sinus node and called sinus tachycardia.   Other conditions that increase sympathetic nervous system activity in the heart include ingested or injected substances, such as caffeine or amphetamines, and an overactive thyroid gland  or anemia. Tachycardia that is not sinus tachycardia usually results from the addition of abnormal impulses to the normal cardiac cycle.   Abnormal impulses can begin by one of three mechanisms: automaticity, re-entry, or triggered activity.   A specialized form of re-entry which is both common and problematic is termed fibrillation. Although the term "tachycardia" has been known for over 160 years, bases for the classification of arrhythmias are still being discussed Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
