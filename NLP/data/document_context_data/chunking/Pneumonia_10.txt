Pneumonia Pneumonia  Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States.  The number of cases of fungal pneumonia has been increasing in the latter half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.  For people infected with HIV/AIDS, PCP is a common opportunistic infection. A variety of parasites can affect the lungs, including Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae.  These organisms typically enter the body through direct contact with the skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector.  Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not specifically affect the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites.  Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia Pneumonia Pneumonia
