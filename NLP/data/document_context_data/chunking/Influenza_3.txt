Influenza Influenza  There are 3–5 million severe cases annually, with up to 650,000 respiratory-related deaths globally each year.  Deaths most commonly occur in high-risk groups, including young children, the elderly, and people with chronic health conditions.  In temperate regions of the world, the number of influenza cases peaks during winter, whereas in the tropics influenza can occur year-round.  Since the late 1800s, large outbreaks of novel influenza strains that spread globally, called pandemics, have occurred every 10–50 years.  Five flu pandemics have occurred since 1900: the Spanish flu in 1918–1920, which was the most severe flu pandemic, the Asian flu in 1957, the Hong Kong flu in 1968, the Russian flu in 1977, and the swine flu pandemic in 2009. The time between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms, called the incubation period, is 1–4 days, most commonly 1–2 days.  Many infections, however, are asymptomatic Influenza Influenza
