Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses: the medium, in this case, being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill.  In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called a "plaque".  Eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent. In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques, some microbes require culture within live animals.  Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary.  Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals.  Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
