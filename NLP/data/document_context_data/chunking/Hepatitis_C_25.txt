Hepatitis C Hepatitis C  Successful treatment decreases the future risk of hepatocellular carcinoma by 75%. Prior to 2012, sustained response occurred in about 40–50% of those with HCV genotype 1 who received 48 weeks of treatment.  A sustained response was seen in 70–80% of people with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 following 24 weeks of treatment.  A sustained response occurs for about 65% of those with genotype 4 after 48 weeks of treatment.  For those with HCV genotype 6, a 48-week treatment protocol of pegylated interferon and ribavirin results in a higher rate of sustained responses than for genotype 1 .  Further studies are needed to determine results for shorter 24-week treatments and for those given at lower dosages. Around 30%  of those with acute HCV infections will spontaneously clear the virus within six months, before the infection is considered chronic Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
