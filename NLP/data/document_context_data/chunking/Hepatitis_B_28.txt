Hepatitis B Hepatitis B Children are less likely than adults to clear the infection.  More than 95% of people who become infected as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus.  However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection.  This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.  Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.

Co-infection with hepatitis D increases the risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
