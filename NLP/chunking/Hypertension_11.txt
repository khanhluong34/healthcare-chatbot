Hypertension Hypertension  There is evidence that some younger people with prehypertension or 'borderline hypertension' have high cardiac output, an elevated heart rate and normal peripheral resistance, termed hyperkinetic borderline hypertension.  These individuals develop the typical features of established essential hypertension in later life as their cardiac output falls and peripheral resistance rises with age.  Whether this pattern is typical of all people who ultimately develop hypertension is disputed.  The increased peripheral resistance in established hypertension is mainly attributable to structural narrowing of small arteries and arterioles, although a reduction in the number or density of capillaries may also contribute. It is not clear whether or not vasoconstriction of arteriolar blood vessels plays a role in hypertension.  Hypertension is also associated with decreased peripheral venous compliance which may increase venous return, increase cardiac preload and, ultimately, cause diastolic dysfunction. Pulse pressure  is frequently increased in older people with hypertension Hypertension Hypertension
