Influenza Influenza  The virion is then released from the cell.  The sialidase activity of NA also cleaves any sialic acid residues from the viral surface, which helps prevent newly assembled viruses from aggregating near the cell surface and improving infectivity.  Similar to other aspects of influenza replication, optimal NA activity is temperature- and pH-dependent.  Ultimately, presence of large quantities of viral RNA in the cell triggers apoptosis, i. e.  programmed cell death, which is initiated by cellular factors to restrict viral replication. Two key processes that influenza viruses evolve through are antigenic drift and antigenic shift Influenza Influenza
