Pancreatitis Pancreatitis  Diabetes mellitus type 2 is associated with a 2. 8-fold higher risk. Less common causes include pancreatic cancer, pancreatic duct stones, vasculitis , and porphyria—particularly acute intermittent porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria. There is an inherited form that results in the activation of trypsinogen within the pancreas, leading to autodigestion.  Involved genes may include trypsin 1, which codes for trypsinogen, SPINK1, which codes for a trypsin inhibitor, or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The mnemonic GETSMASHED is often used to remember the common causes of pancreatitis: G—gallstones, E—ethanol, T—trauma, S—steroids, M—mumps, A—autoimmune pancreatitis, S—scorpion sting, H—hyperlipidemia, hypothermia, hyperparathyroidism, E—endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, D—drugs . The differential diagnosis for pancreatitis includes but is not limited to cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, perforated peptic ulcer, bowel infarction, small bowel obstruction, hepatitis, and mesenteric ischemia Pancreatitis Pancreatitis
