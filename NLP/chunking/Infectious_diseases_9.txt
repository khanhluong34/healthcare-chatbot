Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Given sufficient effort, all known infectious agents can be specifically identified.  The benefits of identification, however, are often greatly outweighed by the cost, as often there is no specific treatment, the cause is obvious, or the outcome of an infection is benign. Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by medical history and physical examination.  More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient.  Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features, by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens, and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype.  Other techniques  are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent.  The images are useful in detection of, for example, a bone abscess or a spongiform encephalopathy produced by a prion Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
