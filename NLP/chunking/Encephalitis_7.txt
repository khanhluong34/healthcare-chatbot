Systematic reviews have been unable to draw firm conclusions because of a lack of randomised double-blind studies with sufficient numbers of patients and sufficient follow-up.  There is the possibility of a benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin for some forms of childhood encephalitis on some indicators such as length of hospital stay, time to stop spasms, time to regain consciousness, and time to resolution of neuropathic symptoms and fever.   Intravenous immunoglobulin for Japanese Encephalitis appeared to have no benefit when compared with placebo  treatment.

In contrast, a normal encephalogram at the early stages of diagnosis is associated with high rates of survival.
