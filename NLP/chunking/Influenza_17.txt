Influenza Influenza  Antigenic evolution of influenza viruses of humans appears to be faster than influenza viruses in swine and equines.  In wild birds, within-subtype antigenic variation appears to be limited but has been observed in poultry. Antigenic shift is a sudden, drastic change in an influenza virus's antigen, usually HA.  During antigenic shift, antigenically different strains that infect the same cell can reassort genome segments with each other, producing hybrid progeny.  Since all influenza viruses have segmented genomes, all are capable of reassortment.  Antigenic shift, however, only occurs among influenza viruses of the same genus and most commonly occurs among IAVs.  In particular, reassortment is very common in AIVs, creating a large diversity of influenza viruses in birds, but is uncommon in human, equine, and canine lineages Influenza Influenza
