Hepatitis C Hepatitis C HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with injection drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions.  In regions where blood screening has been implemented, the risk of contracting HCV from a transfusion has dropped substantially to less than one per two million.  HCV may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth.  It is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.  It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.
