Obesity Obesity  As of 2006, more than 41 of these sites on the human genome have been linked to the development of obesity when a favorable environment is present.  People with two copies of the FTO gene  have been found on average to weigh 3–4 kg more and have a 1. 67-fold greater risk of obesity compared with those without the risk allele.  The differences in BMI between people that are due to genetics varies depending on the population examined from 6% to 85%. Obesity is a major feature in several syndromes, such as Prader–Willi syndrome, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, Cohen syndrome, and MOMO syndrome.   In people with early-onset severe obesity , 7% harbor a single point DNA mutation. Studies that have focused on inheritance patterns rather than on specific genes have found that 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were also obese, in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight Obesity Obesity
