Pneumonia Pneumonia Several developments in the 1900s improved the outcome for those with pneumonia.  With the advent of penicillin and other antibiotics, modern surgical techniques, and intensive care in the 20th century, mortality from pneumonia, which had approached 30%, dropped precipitously in the developed world.  Vaccination of infants against Haemophilus influenzae type B began in 1988 and led to a dramatic decline in cases shortly thereafter.  Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults began in 1977, and in children in 2000, resulting in a similar decline. Due to the relatively low awareness of the disease, 12 November was declared as the annual World Pneumonia Day, a day for concerned citizens and policy makers to take action against the disease, in 2009. The global economic cost of community-acquired pneumonia has been estimated at $17Â billion annually.  Other estimates are considerably higher Pneumonia Pneumonia
