Hypertension Hypertension In hypertensive urgency, there is no evidence of end organ damage resulting from the elevated blood pressure.  In these cases, oral medications are used to lower the BP gradually over 24 to 48 hours. In hypertensive emergency, there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs.  The most affected organs include the brain, kidney, heart and lungs, producing symptoms which may include confusion, drowsiness, chest pain and breathlessness.  In hypertensive emergency, the blood pressure must be reduced more rapidly to stop ongoing organ damage, however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trial evidence for this approach. Hypertension occurs in approximately 8–10% of pregnancies.  Two blood pressure measurements six hours apart of greater than 140/90 mm Hg are diagnostic of hypertension in pregnancy Hypertension Hypertension
