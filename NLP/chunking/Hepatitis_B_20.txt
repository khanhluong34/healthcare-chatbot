Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase  levels and inflammation of the liver, if they are in the immune clearance phase of chronic infection.  Carriers who have seroconverted to HBeAg negative status, in particular those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others.  However, it is possible for individuals to enter an "immune escape" with HBeAg-negative hepatitis. PCR tests have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens.  These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment.  Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy. Vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B have been routinely recommended for babies since 1991 in the United States Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
