Infectious diseases Infectious diseases Similarly, mutations in the ERAP2 gene, encoding endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2, seem to increase the susceptibility to the plague, the disease caused by an infection with the bacteria Yersinia pestis.  People who inherited two copies of a complete variant of the gene were twice as likely to have survived the plague as those who inherited two copies of a truncated variant. Susceptibility also determined the epidemiology of infection, given that different populations have different genetic and environmental conditions that affect infections. In 2010, about 10 million people died of infectious diseases. The World Health Organization collects information on global deaths by International Classification of Disease  code categories.  The following table lists the top infectious disease by number of deaths in 2002.  1993 data is included for comparison Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
