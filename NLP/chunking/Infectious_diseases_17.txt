Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection, although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function. Serological methods are highly sensitive, specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms.  These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen.  The antigen, usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent, is bound by the antibody.  This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways, dependent upon the test.  For example, "Strep throat" is often diagnosed within minutes, and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent, S.  pyogenes, that is retrieved from a patient's throat with a cotton swab Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
