Influenza Influenza It is impossible to know when an influenza virus first infected humans or when the first influenza pandemic occurred.  The first influenza epidemic may have occurred around 6,000 BC in China, and possible descriptions of influenza exist in Greek writings from the 5th century BC.  In both 1173â€“1174 AD and 1387 AD, epidemics occurred across Europe that were named "influenza".  Whether these epidemics or others were caused by influenza is unclear since there was then no consistent naming pattern for epidemic respiratory diseases, and "influenza" didn't become clearly associated with respiratory disease until centuries later.  Influenza may have been brought to the Americas as early as 1493, when an epidemic disease resembling influenza killed most of the population of the Antilles. The first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was chronicled in 1510.  It began in East Asia before spreading to North Africa and then Europe Influenza Influenza
