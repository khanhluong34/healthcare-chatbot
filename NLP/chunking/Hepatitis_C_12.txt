Hepatitis C Hepatitis C  It is believed that ten million intravenous drug users are infected with hepatitis C; China , the United States , and Russia  have the highest absolute totals.  Occurrence of hepatitis C among prison inmates in the United States is 10 to 20 times that of the occurrence observed in the general population; this has been attributed to high-risk behavior in prisons such as IDU and tattooing with non-sterile equipment.  Shared intranasal drug use may also be a risk factor. Blood transfusion, transfusion of blood products, or organ transplants without HCV screening carry significant risks of infection.  The United States instituted universal screening in 1992, and Canada instituted universal screening in 1990.  This decreased the risk from one in 200 units to between one in 10,000 to one in 10,000,000 per unit of blood.  This low risk remains as there is a period of about 11â€“70 days between the potential blood donor's acquiring hepatitis C and the blood's testing positive depending on the method Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
