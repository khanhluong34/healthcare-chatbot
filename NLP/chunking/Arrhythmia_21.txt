Arrhythmia Arrhythmia Electrical treatment of arrhythmias also includes cardiac pacing.  Temporary pacing may be necessary for reversible causes of very slow heartbeats, or bradycardia .  A permanent pacemaker may be placed in situations where the bradycardia is not expected to recover. Some cardiologists further sub-specialize into electrophysiology.   In specialized catheter laboratories, they use fine probes inserted through the blood vessels to map electrical activity from within the heart.   This allows abnormal areas of conduction to be located very accurately and subsequently destroyed by heat, cold, electrical, or laser probes in a process called catheter ablation. This procedure may be completely curative for some forms of arrhythmia, but for others, the success rate remains disappointing Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
