Cancer Cancer Diet, physical inactivity, and obesity are related to up to 30–35% of cancer deaths.  In the United States, excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14–20% of cancer deaths.  A UK study including data on over 5 million people showed higher body mass index to be related to at least 10 types of cancer and responsible for around 12,000 cases each year in that country.
