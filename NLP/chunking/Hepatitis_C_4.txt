Hepatitis C Hepatitis C  Acute liver failure due to acute hepatitis C is exceedingly rare.  Symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of liver disease should prompt further tests and can thus help establish a diagnosis of hepatitis C infection early on. Following the acute phase, the infection may resolve spontaneously in 10â€“50% of affected people; this occurs more frequently in young people and females. About 70% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection.  This is defined as the presence of detectable viral replication for at least six months.  Though most experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few decades of a chronic infection, chronic hepatitis C can be associated with fatigue and mild cognitive problems.  After several years, chronic infection may cause cirrhosis or liver cancer Hepatitis C Hepatitis C
