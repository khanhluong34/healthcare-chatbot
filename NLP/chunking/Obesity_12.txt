Other possible contributors to the recent increase of obesity are:  insufficient sleep,  endocrine disruptors ,  decreased variability in ambient temperature,  decreased rates of smoking, because smoking suppresses appetite,  increased use of medications that can cause weight gain ,  proportional increases in ethnic and age groups that tend to be heavier,  pregnancy at a later age ,  epigenetic risk factors passed on generationally,  natural selection for higher BMI, and  assortative mating leading to increased concentration of obesity risk factors .
