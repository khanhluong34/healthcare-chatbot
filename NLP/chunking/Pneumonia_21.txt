Pneumonia Pneumonia  Radiologic findings may not be present in the early stages of the disease, especially in the presence of dehydration, or may be difficult to interpret in the obese or those with a history of lung disease.  Complications such as pleural effusion may also be found on chest radiographs.  Laterolateral chest radiographs can increase the diagnostic accuracy of lung consolidation and pleural effusion. A CT scan can give additional information in indeterminate cases and provide more details in those with an unclear chest radiograph .  They can be used to exclude pulmonary embolism and fungal pneumonia, and detect lung abscesses in those who are not responding to treatments.  However, CT scans are more expensive, have a higher dose of radiation, and cannot be done at bedside. Lung ultrasound may also be useful in helping to make the diagnosis Pneumonia Pneumonia
