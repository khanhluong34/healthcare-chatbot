Hepatitis Hepatitis The purpose of screening for viral hepatitis is to identify people infected with the disease as early as possible, even before symptoms and transaminase elevations may be present.  This allows for early treatment, which can both prevent disease progression and  decrease the likelihood of transmission to others. Hepatitis A causes an acute illness that does not progress to chronic liver disease.  Therefore, the role of screening is to assess immune status in people who are at high risk of contracting the virus, as well as in people with known liver disease for whom hepatitis A infection could lead to liver failure.  People in these groups who are not already immune can receive the hepatitis A vaccine. Those at high risk and in need of screening include:The presence of anti-hepatitis A IgG in the blood indicates past infection with the virus or prior vaccination. The CDC, WHO, USPSTF, and ACOG recommend routine hepatitis B screening for certain high-risk populations Hepatitis Hepatitis
