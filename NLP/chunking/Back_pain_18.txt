A foraminotomy or foraminectomy may also be necessary, if the vertebrae are causing significant nerve root compression.  A discectomy is performed when the intervertebral disc has herniated or torn.  It involves removing the protruding disc, either a portion of it or all of it, that is placing pressure on the nerve root.  Total disc replacement can also be performed, in which the source of the pain  is removed and replaced, while maintaining spinal mobility.
