Meningitis Meningitis  There is no difference in terms of mortality or acute severe neurological complications in children given a maintenance regimen over restricted-fluid regimen, but evidence is in favor of the maintenance regimen in terms of  emergence of chronic severe neurological complications. Additional treatment with corticosteroids  has shown some benefits, such as a reduction of hearing loss, and better short term neurological outcomes in adolescents and adults from high-income countries with low rates of HIV.  Some research has found reduced rates of death while other research has not.  They also appear to be beneficial in those with tuberculosis meningitis, at least in those who are HIV negative. Professional guidelines therefore recommend the commencement of dexamethasone or a similar corticosteroid just before the first dose of antibiotics is given, and continued for fourÂ days.  Given that most of the benefit of the treatment is confined to those with pneumococcal meningitis, some guidelines suggest that dexamethasone be discontinued if another cause for meningitis is identified.  The likely mechanism is suppression of overactive inflammation Meningitis Meningitis
