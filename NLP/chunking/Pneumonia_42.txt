Pneumonia Pneumonia  Occasionally, microorganisms will infect this fluid, causing an empyema.  To distinguish an empyema from the more common simple parapneumonic effusion, the fluid may be collected with a needle , and examined.  If this shows evidence of empyema, complete drainage of the fluid is necessary, often requiring a drainage catheter.  In severe cases of empyema, surgery may be needed.  If the infected fluid is not drained, the infection may persist, because antibiotics do not penetrate well into the pleural cavity.  If the fluid is sterile, it must be drained only if it is causing symptoms or remains unresolved. In rare circumstances, bacteria in the lung will form a pocket of infected fluid called a lung abscess Pneumonia Pneumonia
