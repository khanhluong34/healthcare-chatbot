Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity; however, variants of the hepatitis B virus do not produce the 'e' antigen, so this rule does not always hold true.  During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen  will arise immediately afterwards.  This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication. If the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen .  The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period.  A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBs either has cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously. Individuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
