Sinusitis Sinusitis Halitosis  is often stated to be a symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis; however, gold-standard breath analysis techniques have not been applied.  Theoretically,  several possible mechanisms of both objective and subjective halitosis may be involved. A 2005 review suggested that most "sinus headaches" are migraines.  The confusion occurs in part because migraine involves activation of the trigeminal nerves, which innervate both the sinus region and the meninges surrounding the brain.  As a result, accurately determining the site from which the pain originates is difficult.  People with migraines do not typically have the thick nasal discharge that is a common symptom of a sinus infection. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis may include nasal congestion, facial pain, headache, night-time coughing, an increase in previously minor or controlled asthma symptoms, general malaise, thick green or yellow discharge, feeling of facial fullness or tightness that may worsen when bending over, dizziness, aching teeth, and bad breath Sinusitis Sinusitis
