Back pain Back pain If nonpharmacological measures are ineffective, medication may be administered. Surgery for back pain is typically used as a last resort, when serious neurological deficit is evident.  A 2009 systematic review of back surgery studies found that, for certain diagnoses, surgery is moderately better than other common treatments, but the benefits of surgery often decline in the long term. Surgery may sometimes be appropriate for people with severe myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome.  Causes of neurological deficits can include spinal disc herniation, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, tumor, infection, and spinal hematomas, all of which can impinge on the nerve roots around the spinal cord.  There are multiple surgical options to treat back pain, and these options vary depending on the cause of the pain. When a herniated disc is compressing the nerve roots, hemi- or partial- laminectomy or discectomy may be performed, in which the material compressing on the nerve is removed Back pain Back pain
