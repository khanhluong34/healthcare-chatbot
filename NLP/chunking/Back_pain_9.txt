Back pain Back pain  The pain can be associated with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, chills, fever, nausea and vomiting.  Unlike other causes of back pain, neoplasm-associated back pain is constant, dull, poorly localized and worsens with rest.  Metastasis to the bone also increases the risk of spinal-cord compression or vertebral fractures that require emergency surgical treatment. Inflammatory arthritides such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus can all cause varying levels of joint destruction.  Among the inflammatory arthritides, ankylosing spondylitis is most closely associated with back pain because of the inflammatory destruction of the bony components of the spine.  Ankylosing spondylitis is common in young men and presents with a range of possible symptoms such as uveitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease.
