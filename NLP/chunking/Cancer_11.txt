Cancer Cancer It is not generally possible to prove what caused a particular cancer because the various causes do not have specific fingerprints.  For example, if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer, then it was probably caused by the tobacco use, but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation, the cancer may have developed for one of those reasons.  Excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and occasional organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease, however factors that may have contributed to the development of cancer can be transmissible; such as oncoviruses like hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr virus and HIV. Exposure to particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer.  These substances are called carcinogens. Tobacco smoke, for example, causes 90% of lung cancer.  It also causes cancer in the larynx, head, neck, stomach, bladder, kidney, esophagus and pancreas Cancer Cancer
