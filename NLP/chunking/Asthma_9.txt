Asthma Asthma  Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction.  Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets. Use of antibiotics in early life has been linked to the development of asthma.  Also, delivery via caesarean section is associated with an increased risk  of asthma – this increased risk is attributed to the lack of healthy bacterial colonization that the newborn would have acquired from passage through the birth canal.  There is a link between asthma and the degree of affluence which may be related to the hygiene hypothesis as less affluent individuals often have more exposure to bacteria and viruses. Family history is a risk factor for asthma, with many different genes being implicated.  If one identical twin is affected, the probability of the other having the disease is approximately 25% Asthma Asthma
