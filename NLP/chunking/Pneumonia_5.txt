Pneumonia Pneumonia Pneumonia is due to infections caused primarily by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites.  Although more than 100 strains of infectious agents have been identified, only a few are responsible for the majority of cases.  Mixed infections with both viruses and bacteria may occur in roughly 45% of infections in children and 15% of infections in adults.  A causative agent may not be isolated in about half of cases despite careful testing.  In an active population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in five hospitals in Chicago and Nashville from January 2010 through June 2012, 2259 patients were identified who had radiographic evidence of pneumonia and specimens that could be tested for the responsible pathogen.  Most patients  had no detectable pathogens in their sample, and unexpectedly, respiratory viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria.  Specifically, 23% had one or more viruses, 11% had one or more bacteria, 3% had both bacterial and viral pathogens, and 1% had a fungal or mycobacterial infection Pneumonia Pneumonia
