Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001. A general method to prevent transmission of vector-borne pathogens is pest control. In cases where infection is merely suspected, individuals may be quarantined until the incubation period has passed and the disease manifests itself or the person remains healthy.  Groups may undergo quarantine, or in the case of communities, a cordon sanitaire may be imposed to prevent infection from spreading beyond the community, or in the case of protective sequestration, into a community.  Public health authorities may implement other forms of social distancing, such as school closings, lockdowns or temporary restrictions  to control an epidemic. Infection with most pathogens does not result in death of the host and the offending organism is ultimately cleared after the symptoms of the disease have waned.  This process requires immune mechanisms to kill or inactivate the inoculum of the pathogen Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
