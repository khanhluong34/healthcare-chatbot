Mental illness Mental illness Factitious disorders are diagnosed where symptoms are thought to be reported for personal gain.  Symptoms are often deliberately produced or feigned, and may relate to either symptoms in the individual or in someone close to them, particularly people they care for. There are attempts to introduce a category of relational disorder, where the diagnosis is of a relationship rather than on any one individual in that relationship.  The relationship may be between children and their parents, between couples, or others.  There already exists, under the category of psychosis, a diagnosis of shared psychotic disorder where two or more individuals share a particular delusion because of their close relationship with each other. There are a number of uncommon psychiatric syndromes, which are often named after the person who first described them, such as Capgras syndrome, DeÂ Clerambault syndrome, Othello syndrome, Ganser syndrome, Cotard delusion, and Ekbom syndrome, and additional disorders such as the Couvade syndrome and Geschwind syndrome. The onset of psychiatric disorders usually occurs from childhood to early adulthood Mental illness Mental illness
