Hypertension Hypertension  The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening adults 18 years or older for hypertension with office blood pressure measurement. According to one review published in 2003, reduction of the blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischemic heart disease by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Various expert groups have produced guidelines regarding how low the blood pressure target should be when a person is treated for hypertension.  These groups recommend a target below the range 140–160 / 90–100 mmHg for the general population.  Cochrane reviews recommend similar targets for subgroups such as people with diabetes and people with prior cardiovascular disease.  Additionally, Cochrane reviews have found that for older individuals with moderate to high cardiovascular risk, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower than standard blood pressure target  are outweighed by the risk associated with the intervention.  These findings may not be applicable to other populations Hypertension Hypertension
