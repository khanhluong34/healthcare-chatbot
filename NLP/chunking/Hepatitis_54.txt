Hepatitis Hepatitis   Krugman injected students with gamma globulin, a type of antibody.   After observing the temporary protection against infection this antibody provided, he then tried injected live hepatitis virus into students.   Krugman also controversially took feces from infected students, blended it into milkshakes, and fed it to newly admitted children. His research was received with much controversy, as people protested the questionable ethics surrounding the chosen target population.   Henry Beecher was one of the foremost critics in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1966, arguing that parents were unaware to the risks of consent and that the research was done to benefit others at the expense of children.   Moreover, he argued that poor families with mentally disabled children often felt pressured to join the research project to gain admission to the school, with all of the educational and support resources that would come along with it.  Others in the medical community spoke out in support of Krugman's research in terms of its widespread benefits and understanding of the hepatitis virus, and Willowbrook continues to be a commonly cited example in debates about medical ethics Hepatitis Hepatitis
