Meningitis Meningitis  The first recorded major outbreak occurred in Geneva in 1805.  Several other epidemics in Europe and the United States were described shortly afterward, and the first report of an epidemic in Africa appeared in 1840.  African epidemics became much more common in the 20th century, starting with a major epidemic sweeping Nigeria and Ghana in 1905–1908. The first report of bacterial infection underlying meningitis was by the Austrian bacteriologist Anton Weichselbaum, who in 1887 described the meningococcus.  Mortality from meningitis was very high  in early reports.  In 1906, antiserum was produced in horses; this was developed further by the American scientist Simon Flexner and markedly decreased mortality from meningococcal disease.  In 1944, penicillin was first reported to be effective in meningitis Meningitis Meningitis
