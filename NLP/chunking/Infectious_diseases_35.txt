Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Specific acquired immunity against infectious diseases may be mediated by antibodies and/or T lymphocytes.  Immunity mediated by these two factors may be manifested by:The immune system response to a microorganism often causes symptoms such as a high fever and inflammation, and has the potential to be more devastating than direct damage caused by a microbe. Resistance to infection  may be acquired following a disease, by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen, by harboring an organism with a similar structure , or by vaccination.  Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens. 
There is also the phenomenon of herd immunity which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections. Immune resistance to an infectious disease requires a critical level of either antigen-specific antibodies and/or T cells when the host encounters the pathogen.  Some individuals develop natural serum antibodies to the surface polysaccharides of some agents although they have had little or no contact with the agent, these natural antibodies confer specific protection to adults and are passively transmitted to newborns Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
