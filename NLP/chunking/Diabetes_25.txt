Diabetes Diabetes  According to the ADA, "reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia", and for individuals with type 2 diabetes who cannot meet the glycemic targets or where reducing anti-glycemic medications is a priority, low or very-low carbohydrate diets are a viable approach.  For overweight people with type 2 diabetes, any diet that achieves weight loss is effective. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review compared several non-nutritive sweeteners to sugar, placebo and a nutritive low-calorie sweetener , but the results were unclear for effects on HbA1c, body weight and adverse events.  The studies included were mainly of very low-certainty and did not report on health-related quality of life, diabetes complications, all-cause mortality or socioeconomic effects. Most medications used to treat diabetes act by lowering blood sugar levels through different mechanisms.  There is broad consensus that when people with diabetes maintain tight glucose control – keeping the glucose levels in their blood within normal ranges – they experience fewer complications, such as kidney problems or eye problems.  There is however debate as to whether this is appropriate and cost effective for people later in life in whom the risk of hypoglycemia may be more significant Diabetes Diabetes
