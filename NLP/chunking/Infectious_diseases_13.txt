Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent.  Chagas disease is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis.  In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the Chagas agent T.  cruzi, an uninfected triatomine bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected.  The bug is later inspected for growth of T.  cruzi within its gut. Another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is microscopy Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
