Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  The prion causing mad cow disease and Creutzfeldtâ€“Jakob disease invariably kills all animals and people that are infected. Persistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection.  Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism, often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection.  There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body.  Some viruses once acquired never leave the body.  A typical example is the herpes virus, which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise. Persistent infections cause millions of deaths globally each year Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
