Pneumonia Pneumonia  If a person is sufficiently sick to require hospitalization, a chest radiograph is recommended.  Findings do not always match the severity of disease and do not reliably separate between bacterial and viral infection. X-ray presentations of pneumonia may be classified as lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, lobular pneumonia, and interstitial pneumonia.  Bacterial, community-acquired pneumonia classically show lung consolidation of one lung segmental lobe, which is known as lobar pneumonia.  However, findings may vary, and other patterns are common in other types of pneumonia.  Aspiration pneumonia may present with bilateral opacities primarily in the bases of the lungs and on the right side.  Radiographs of viral pneumonia may appear normal, appear hyper-inflated, have bilateral patchy areas, or present similar to bacterial pneumonia with lobar consolidation Pneumonia Pneumonia
