It is not clear if any of these therapies are helpful or worsen outcomes in people with acute bacterial meningitis. Viral meningitis typically only requires supportive therapy; most viruses responsible for causing meningitis are not amenable to specific treatment.  Viral meningitis tends to run a more benign course than bacterial meningitis.  Herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus may respond to treatment with antiviral drugs such as aciclovir, but there are no clinical trials that have specifically addressed whether this treatment is effective.  Mild cases of viral meningitis can be treated at home with conservative measures such as fluid, bedrest, and analgesics. Fungal meningitis, such as cryptococcal meningitis, is treated with long courses of high dose antifungals, such as amphotericin B and flucytosine Meningitis Meningitis
