Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  Two further types have since been described .  Most genotypes are now divided into subgenotypes with distinct properties. Hepatitis B virus primarily interferes with the functions of the liver by replicating in hepatocytes.  A functional receptor is NTCP.  There is evidence that the receptor in the closely related duck hepatitis B virus is carboxypeptidase D.  The virions bind to the host cell via the preS domain of the viral surface antigen and are subsequently internalized by endocytosis.  HBV-preS-specific receptors are expressed primarily on hepatocytes; however, viral DNA and proteins have also been detected in extrahepatic sites, suggesting that cellular receptors for HBV may also exist on extrahepatic cells Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
