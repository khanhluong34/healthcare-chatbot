Cancer Cancer  Each of these alterations regulates gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence.  These changes may remain through cell divisions, endure for multiple generations, and can be considered as equivalent to mutations. Epigenetic alterations occur frequently in cancers.  As an example, one study listed protein coding genes that were frequently altered in their methylation in association with colon cancer.  These included 147 hypermethylated and 27 hypomethylated genes.  Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers. While epigenetic alterations are found in cancers, the epigenetic alterations in DNA repair genes, causing reduced expression of DNA repair proteins, may be of particular importance Cancer Cancer
