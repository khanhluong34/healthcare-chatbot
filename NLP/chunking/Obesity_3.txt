Obesity Obesity  For adults, the World Health Organization  defines "overweight" as a BMI 25 or higher, and "obese" as a BMI 30 or higher.  The U. S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  further subdivides obesity based on BMI, with a BMI 30 to 35 called class 1 obesity; 35 to 40, class 2 obesity; and 40+, class 3 obesity. For children, obesity measures take age into consideration along with height and weight.  For children aged 5â€“19, the WHO defines obesity as a BMI two standard deviations above the median for their age .  For children under five, the WHO defines obesity as a weight three standard deviations above the median for their height Obesity Obesity
