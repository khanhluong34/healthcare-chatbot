Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  The core protein is coded for by gene C , and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced.  HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein.  In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present. 
The DNA polymerase is encoded by gene P.  Gene S is the gene that codes for the surface antigen .  The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame "start"  codons that divide the gene into three sections, pre-S1, pre-S2, and S.  Because of the multiple start codons, polypeptides of three different sizes called large , middle , and small  are produced Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
