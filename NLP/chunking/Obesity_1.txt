Obesity Obesity  There is no effective, well-defined, evidence-based intervention for preventing obesity.  Obesity prevention requires a complex approach, including interventions at societal, community, family, and individual levels.  Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments recommended by health professionals.  Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat or sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber, if these dietary choices are available, affordable, and accessible.  Medications can be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption.  If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier, or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.
