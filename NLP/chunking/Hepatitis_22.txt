Hepatitis Hepatitis Blood testing includes liver enzymes, serology , nucleic acid testing , blood chemistry, and complete blood count.  Characteristic patterns of liver enzyme abnormalities can point to certain causes or stages of hepatitis.  Generally, AST and ALT are elevated in most cases of hepatitis regardless of whether the person shows any symptoms.  The degree of elevation , the predominance for AST vs.  ALT elevation, and the ratio between AST and ALT are informative of the diagnosis. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI can all identify steatosis  of the liver tissue and nodularity of the liver surface suggestive of cirrhosis.  CT and especially MRI are able to provide a higher level of detail, allowing visualization and characterize such structures as vessels and tumors within the liver Hepatitis Hepatitis
