Pneumonia Pneumonia In general, aspiration pneumonitis is treated conservatively with antibiotics indicated only for aspiration pneumonia.  The choice of antibiotic will depend on several factors, including the suspected causative organism and whether pneumonia was acquired in the community or developed in a hospital setting.  Common options include clindamycin, a combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic and metronidazole, or an aminoglycoside. 
Corticosteroids are sometimes used in aspiration pneumonia, but there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness. The British Thoracic Society recommends that a follow-up chest radiograph be taken in people with persistent symptoms, smokers, and people older than 50.  American guidelines vary, from generally recommending a follow-up chest radiograph to not mentioning any follow-up. With treatment, most types of bacterial pneumonia will stabilize in 3–6 days Pneumonia Pneumonia
