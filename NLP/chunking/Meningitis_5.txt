Meningitis Meningitis  A person is asked to rapidly rotate the head horizontally; if this does not make the headache worse, meningitis is unlikely. Other problems can produce symptoms similar to those above, but from non-meningitic causes.  This is called meningism or pseudomeningitis. Meningitis caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis  can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a rapidly spreading petechial rash, which may precede other symptoms.  The rash consists of numerous small, irregular purple or red spots  on the trunk, lower extremities, mucous membranes, conjunctiva, and  the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.  The rash is typically non-blanching; the redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler.  Although this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis, it is relatively specific for the disease; it does, however, occasionally occur in meningitis due to other bacteria Meningitis Meningitis
