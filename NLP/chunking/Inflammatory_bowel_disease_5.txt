Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease   Oxidative DNA damage as measured by 8-OHdG levels was found to be significantly increased in patients with IBD compared to control patients, and in inflamed mucosa compared with non-inflamed mucosa. A genetic component to IBD has been recognized for over a century.  Research that has contributed to understanding of the genetics include studies of ethnic groups , familial clustering, epidemiological studies, and twin studies.  With the advent of molecular genetics, understanding of the genetic basis has expanded considerably, particularly in the past decade.  The first gene linked to IBD was NOD2 in 2001.  Genome-wide association studies have since added to understanding of the genomics and pathogenesis of the disease.  More than 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms  are now known to be associated with susceptibility to IBD Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
