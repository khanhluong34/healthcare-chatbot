Asthma Asthma  Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers.  Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry lung function testing.  Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second , and peak expiratory flow rate.  It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. There is no known cure for asthma, but it can be controlled.  Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and respiratory irritants, and suppressed with the use of inhaled corticosteroids.  Long-acting beta agonists  or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled Asthma Asthma
