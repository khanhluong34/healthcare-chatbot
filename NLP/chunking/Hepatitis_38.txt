Hepatitis Hepatitis  Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC are most effective at reducing short-term mortality.  Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis.  In these cases PTX may be considered on a case-by-case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is better than no treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo.  Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients' risk of dying in the longer term, at 3â€“12 months and beyond. Weak evidence suggests milk thistle extracts may improve survival in alcoholic liver disease and improve certain liver tests  without causing side effects, but a firm recommendation cannot be made for or against milk thistle without further study. The modified Maddrey's discriminant function may be used to evaluate the severity and prognosis in alcoholic hepatitis and evaluates the efficacy of using alcoholic hepatitis corticosteroid treatment. Autoimmune hepatitis is commonly treated by immunosuppressants such as the corticosteroids prednisone or prednisolone, the active version of prednisolone that does not require liver synthesis, either alone or in combination with azathioprine, and some have suggested the combination therapy is preferred to allow for lower doses of corticosteroids to reduce associated side effects, although the result of treatment efficacy is comparative Hepatitis Hepatitis
