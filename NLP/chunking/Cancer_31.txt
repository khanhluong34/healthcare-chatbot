Cancer Cancer  During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damage, incompletely cleared repair sites can cause epigenetic gene silencing. Deficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can increase cancer risks.  Individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes  have increased cancer risk, with some defects ensuring a 100% lifetime chance of cancer .  Germ line DNA repair mutations are noted on the figure's left side.  However, such germline mutations  are the cause of only about 1 percent of cancers. In sporadic cancers, deficiencies in DNA repair are occasionally caused by a mutation in a DNA repair gene but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes.  This is indicated in the figure at the 3rd level Cancer Cancer
