Cancer Cancer Normal cells typically generate only about 30% of energy from glycolysis, whereas most cancers rely on glycolysis for energy production .  But a minority of cancer types rely on oxidative phosphorylation as the primary energy source, including lymphoma, leukemia, and endometrial cancer.  Even in these cases, however, the use of glycolysis as an energy source rarely exceeds 60%.  A few cancers use glutamine as the major energy source, partly because it provides nitrogen required for nucleotide  synthesis.  Cancer stem cells often use oxidative phosphorylation or glutamine as a primary energy source. Several studies have indicated that the enzyme sirtuin 6 is selectively inactivated during oncogenesis in a variety of tumor types by inducing glycolysis.  Another sirtuin, sirtuin 3 inhibits cancers that depend upon glycolysis, but promotes cancers that depend upon oxidative phosphorylation Cancer Cancer
