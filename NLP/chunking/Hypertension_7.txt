Hypertension Hypertension In contrast, gestational hypertension is defined as new-onset hypertension during pregnancy without protein in the urine. Failure to thrive, seizures, irritability, lack of energy, and difficulty in breathing can be associated with hypertension in newborns and young infants.  In older infants and children, hypertension can cause headache, unexplained irritability, fatigue, failure to thrive, blurred vision, nosebleeds, and facial paralysis. Hypertension results from a complex interaction of genes and environmental factors.  Numerous common genetic variants with small effects on blood pressure have been identified as well as some rare genetic variants with large effects on blood pressure.  Also, genome-wide association studies  have identified 35 genetic loci related to blood pressure; 12 of these genetic loci influencing blood pressure were newly found.  Sentinel SNP for each new genetic locus identified has shown an association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites Hypertension Hypertension
