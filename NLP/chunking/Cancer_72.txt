Cancer Cancer  Animals, typically rodents, are often used in cancer research and studies of natural cancers in larger animals may benefit research into human cancer. Across wild animals, there is still limited data on cancer.  Nonetheless, a study published in 2022, explored cancer risk in  zoo mammals, belonging to 191 species, 110,148 individual, demonstrated that cancer is a ubiquitous disease of mammals and it can emerge anywhere along the mammalian phylogeny.  This research also highlighted that cancer risk is not uniformly distributed along mammals.  For instance, species in the order Carnivora are particularly prone to be affected by cancer , while ungulates  appear to face consistently low cancer risks. In non-humans, a few types of transmissible cancer have also been described, wherein the cancer spreads between animals by transmission of the tumor cells themselves.  This phenomenon is seen in dogs with Sticker's sarcoma , and in Tasmanian devils with devil facial tumour disease  Cancer Cancer
