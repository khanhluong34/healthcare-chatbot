Hypertension Hypertension Excessive sodium or insufficient potassium in the diet leads to excessive intracellular sodium, which contracts vascular smooth muscle, restricting blood flow and so increases blood pressure. Hypertension is diagnosed on the basis of a persistently high resting blood pressure.  The American Heart Association  recommends at least three resting measurements on at least two separate health care visits.  The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension if a clinic blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or higher. For an accurate diagnosis of hypertension to be made, it is essential for proper blood pressure measurement technique to be used.  Improper measurement of blood pressure is common and can change the blood pressure reading by up to 10 mmHg, which can lead to misdiagnosis and misclassification of hypertension.  Correct blood pressure measurement technique involves several steps Hypertension Hypertension
