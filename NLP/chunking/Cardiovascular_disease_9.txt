Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  In addition, physical activity assists weight loss and improves blood glucose control, blood pressure, lipid profile and insulin sensitivity.  These effects may, at least in part, explain its cardiovascular benefits. High dietary intakes of saturated fat, trans-fats and salt, and low intake of fruits, vegetables and fish are linked to cardiovascular risk, although whether all these associations indicate causes is disputed.  The World Health Organization attributes approximately 1. 7 million deaths worldwide to low fruit and vegetable consumption.   Frequent consumption of high-energy foods, such as processed foods that are high in fats and sugars, promotes obesity and may increase cardiovascular risk.   The amount of dietary salt consumed may also be an important determinant of blood pressure levels and overall cardiovascular risk Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
