Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria.  The most common classes of antibiotics used in medicine include penicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones and tetracyclines. Not all infections require treatment, and for many self-limiting infections the treatment may cause more side-effects than benefits.  Antimicrobial stewardship is the concept that healthcare providers should treat an infection with an antimicrobial that specifically works well for the target pathogen for the shortest amount of time and to only treat when there is a known or highly suspected pathogen that will respond to the medication. Pandemics such as COVID-19 show that people dramatically differ in their susceptibility to infection.  This may be because of general health, age, or their immune status, e. g Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
