Obesity Obesity  People with class I obesity and heart disease do not have greater rates of further heart problems than people of normal weight who also have heart disease.  In people with greater degrees of obesity, however, the risk of further cardiovascular events is increased.  Even after cardiac bypass surgery, no increase in mortality is seen in the overweight and obese.  One study found that the improved survival could be explained by the more aggressive treatment obese people receive after a cardiac event.  Another study found that if one takes into account chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  in those with PAD, the benefit of obesity no longer exists. The "a calorie is a calorie" model of obesity posits a combination of excessive food energy intake and a lack of physical activity as the cause of most cases of obesity.  A limited number of cases are due primarily to genetics, medical reasons, or psychiatric illness Obesity Obesity
