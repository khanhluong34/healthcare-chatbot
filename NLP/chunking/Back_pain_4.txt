Treatment of sensitization may involve low doses of antidepressants and directed rehabilitation such as physical therapy. Spinal disc disease occurs when the nucleus pulposus, a gel-like material in the inner core of the vertebral disc, ruptures.  Rupturing of the nucleus pulposus can lead to compression of nerve roots.  Symptoms may be unilateral or bilateral, and correlate to the region of the spine affected.  The most common region for spinal disk disease is at L4–L5 or L5–S1.  The risk for lumbar disc disease is increased in overweight individuals because of the increased compressive force on the nucleus pulposus, and is twice as likely to occur in men Back pain Back pain
