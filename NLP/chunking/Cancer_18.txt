Cancer Cancer  Hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect.  Less than 0. 3% of the population are carriers of a genetic mutation that has a large effect on cancer risk and these cause less than 3â€“10% of cancer.  Some of these syndromes include: certain inherited mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 with a more than 75% risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer , which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer, among others. Statistically for cancers causing most mortality, the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer when a first-degree relative  has been diagnosed with it is about 2.  The corresponding relative risk is 1. 5 for lung cancer, and 1 Cancer Cancer
