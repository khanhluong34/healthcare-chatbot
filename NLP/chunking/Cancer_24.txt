Cancer Cancer  People with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk, but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis and strict treatment, probably due to the adoption of a gluten-free diet, which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease.  However, the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a gluten-free diet seems to increase the risk of malignancies.  Rates of gastrointestinal cancers are increased in people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, due to chronic inflammation.  Also, immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat these diseases may promote developing extra-intestinal malignancies. Cancer is fundamentally a disease of tissue growth regulation.  For a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell, the genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered. The affected genes are divided into two broad categories Cancer Cancer
