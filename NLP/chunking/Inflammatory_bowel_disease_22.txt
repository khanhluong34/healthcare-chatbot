Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease Currently, the probiotic strain, frequency, dose and duration of the probiotic therapy are not established.  In severely ill people with IBD there is a risk of the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs  and subsequent bacteremia, which can cause serious adverse health consequences.  Live bacteria might not be essential because of beneficial effects of probiotics seems to be mediated by their DNA and by secreted soluble factors, and their therapeutic effects may be obtained by systemic administration rather than oral administration. In 2005 New Scientist published a joint study by Bristol University and the University of Bath on the apparent healing power of cannabis on IBD.  Reports that cannabis eased IBD symptoms indicated the possible existence of cannabinoid receptors in the intestinal lining, which respond to molecules in the plant-derived chemicals.  CB1 cannabinoid receptors – which are known to be present in the brain – exist in the endothelial cells which line the gut, it is thought that they are involved in repairing the lining of the gut when damaged. The team deliberately damaged the cells to cause inflammation of the gut lining and then added synthetically produced cannabinoids; the result was that gut started to heal: the broken cells were repaired and brought back closer together to mend the tears Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
