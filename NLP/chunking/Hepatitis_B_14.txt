Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  The virus gains entry into the cell by binding to NTCP on the surface and being endocytosed.  Because the virus multiplies via RNA made by a host enzyme, the viral genomic DNA has to be transferred to the cell nucleus by host proteins called chaperones.  The partially double-stranded viral DNA is then made fully double stranded by a viral polymerase and transformed into covalently closed circular DNA .  This cccDNA serves as a template for transcription of four viral mRNAs by host RNA polymerase.  The largest mRNA, , is used to make the new copies of the genome and to make the capsid core protein and the viral DNA polymerase.  These four viral transcripts undergo additional processing and go on to form progeny virions that are released from the cell or returned to the nucleus and re-cycled to produce even more copies.  The long mRNA is then transported back to the cytoplasm where the virion P protein  synthesizes DNA via its reverse transcriptase activity Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
