Hepatitis Hepatitis Many chemical agents, including medications, industrial toxins, and herbal and dietary supplements, can cause hepatitis.  The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury varies from acute hepatitis to chronic hepatitis to acute liver failure.  Toxins and medications can cause liver injury through a variety of mechanisms, including direct cell damage, disruption of cell metabolism, and causing structural changes.  Some drugs such as paracetamol exhibit predictable dose-dependent liver damage while others such as isoniazid cause idiosyncratic and unpredictable reactions that vary by person.  There are wide variations in the mechanisms of liver injury and latency period from exposure to development of clinical illness. Many types of drugs can cause liver injury, including the analgesic paracetamol; antibiotics such as isoniazid, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; anticonvulsants such as valproate and phenytoin; cholesterol-lowering statins; steroids such as oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids; and highly active anti-retroviral therapy used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS.  Of these, amoxicillin-clavulanate is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury, and paracetamol toxicity  the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe Hepatitis Hepatitis
