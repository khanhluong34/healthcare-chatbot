Cancer Cancer  Complex error correction and prevention are built into the process and safeguard the cell against cancer.  If a significant error occurs, the damaged cell can self-destruct through programmed cell death, termed apoptosis.  If the error control processes fail, then the mutations will survive and be passed along to daughter cells. Some environments make errors more likely to arise and propagate.  Such environments can include the presence of disruptive substances called carcinogens, repeated physical injury, heat, ionising radiation, or hypoxia. The errors that cause cancer are self-amplifying and compounding, for example:The transformation of a normal cell into cancer is akin to a chain reaction caused by initial errors, which compound into more severe errors, each progressively allowing the cell to escape more controls that limit normal tissue growth.  This rebellion-like scenario is an undesirable survival of the fittest, where the driving forces of evolution work against the body's design and enforcement of order Cancer Cancer
