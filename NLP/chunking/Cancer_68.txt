Cancer Cancer  Treatments that succeeded in one cancer type can be tested against other types.  Diagnostic tests are under development to better target the right therapies to the right patients, based on their individual biology. Cancer research focuses on the following issues:The improved understanding of molecular biology and cellular biology due to cancer research has led to new treatments for cancer since US President Richard Nixon declared the "War on Cancer" in 1971.  Since then, the country has spent over $200Â billion on cancer research, including resources from public and private sectors.  The cancer death rate  declined by five percent between 1950 and 2005. Competition for financial resources appears to have suppressed the creativity, cooperation, risk-taking and original thinking required to make fundamental discoveries, unduly favoring low-risk research into small incremental advancements over riskier, more innovative research.  Other consequences of competition appear to be many studies with dramatic claims whose results cannot be replicated and perverse incentives that encourage grantee institutions to grow without making sufficient investments in their own faculty and facilities Cancer Cancer
