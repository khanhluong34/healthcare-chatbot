Back pain Back pain  In approximately 10 percent of people, a cause can be identified through diagnostic imaging.  Fewer than two percent of cases are attributed to secondary factors, with metastatic cancers and serious infections, such as spinal osteomyelitis and epidural abscesses, accounting for approximately one percent. In as many as 90 percent of cases, no physiological causes or abnormalities on diagnostic tests can be found.  Nonspecific back pain can result from back strain or sprains, which can cause peripheral injury to muscle or ligaments.  Many patients cannot identify the events or activities that may have caused the strain.  The pain can present acutely but in some cases can persist, leading to chronic pain.
