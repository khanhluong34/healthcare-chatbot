Cancer Cancer  Once cancer has begun to develop, this ongoing process, termed clonal evolution, drives progression towards more invasive stages.  Clonal evolution leads to intra-tumour heterogeneity  that complicates designing effective treatment strategies and requires an evolutionary approach to designing treatment. Characteristic abilities developed by cancers are divided into categories, specifically evasion of apoptosis, self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, sustained angiogenesis, limitless replicative potential, metastasis, reprogramming of energy metabolism and evasion of immune destruction. The classical view of cancer is a set of diseases driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes, and in chromosomal abnormalities.  A role for epigenetic alterations was identified in the early 21st century. Epigenetic alterations are functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not change the nucleotide sequence.  Examples of such modifications are changes in DNA methylation , histone modification and changes in chromosomal architecture  Cancer Cancer
