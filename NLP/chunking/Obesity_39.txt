Once considered a problem only of high-income countries, obesity rates are rising worldwide and affecting both the developed and developing world.  These increases have been felt most dramatically in urban settings. Sex- and gender-based differences also influence the prevalence of obesity.  Globally there are more obese women than men, but the numbers differ depending on how obesity is measured. Obesity is from the Latin obesitas, which means "stout, fat, or plump" Obesity Obesity
