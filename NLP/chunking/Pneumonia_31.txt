Pneumonia Pneumonia  There is tentative evidence that laying flat on the back compared to semi-raised increases pneumonia risks in people who are intubated. Antibiotics by mouth, rest, simple analgesics, and fluids usually suffice for complete resolution.  However, those with other medical conditions, the elderly, or those with significant trouble breathing may require more advanced care.  If the symptoms worsen, the pneumonia does not improve with home treatment, or complications occur, hospitalization may be required.  Worldwide, approximately 7–13% of cases in children result in hospitalization, whereas in the developed world between 22 and 42% of adults with community-acquired pneumonia are admitted.  The CURB-65 score is useful for determining the need for admission in adults.  If the score is 0 or 1, people can typically be managed at home; if it is 2, a short hospital stay or close follow-up is needed; if it is 3–5, hospitalization is recommended Pneumonia Pneumonia
