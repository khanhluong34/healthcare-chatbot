Sinusitis Sinusitis  Pain killers such as naproxen, nasal steroids, and nasal irrigation may be used to help with symptoms.  Recommended initial treatment for acute sinusitis is watchful waiting.  If symptoms do not improve in 7â€“10 days or get worse, then an antibiotic may be used or changed.  In those in whom antibiotics are used, either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended first line, with amoxicillin/clavulanate being superior to amoxicillin alone but with more side effects.  Surgery may occasionally be used in people with chronic disease or in someone who is not responding to medicines as per doctor's expectation. Sinusitis is a common condition.  It affects between about 10 and 30 percent of people each year in the United States and Europe Sinusitis Sinusitis
