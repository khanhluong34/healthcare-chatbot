Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  A focal infection is an initial site of infection from which organisms travel via the bloodstream to another area of the body. Among the many varieties of microorganisms, relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals.  Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect.  The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen depend upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen.  However, a host's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection.  Clinicians, therefore, classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses â€“ either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens. Primary pathogens cause disease as a result of their presence or activity within the normal, healthy host, and their intrinsic virulence  is, in part, a necessary consequence of their need to reproduce and spread Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
