Diabetes Diabetes  The disease was considered rare during the time of the Roman empire, with Galen commenting he had only seen two cases during his career.  This is possibly due to the diet and lifestyle of the ancients, or because the clinical symptoms were observed during the advanced stage of the disease.  Galen named the disease "diarrhea of the urine" . The earliest surviving work with a detailed reference to diabetes is that of Aretaeus of Cappadocia .  He described the symptoms and the course of the disease, which he attributed to the moisture and coldness, reflecting the beliefs of the "Pneumatic School".  He hypothesized a correlation between diabetes and other diseases, and he discussed differential diagnosis from the snakebite, which also provokes excessive thirst.  His work remained unknown in the West until 1552, when the first Latin edition was published in Venice Diabetes Diabetes
