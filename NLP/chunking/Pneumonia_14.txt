Pneumonia Pneumonia  The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray. Viruses may reach the lung by a number of different routes.  Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then touch their eyes or nose.  Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the nose or mouth.  Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way into the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma.  Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood.  The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death Pneumonia Pneumonia
