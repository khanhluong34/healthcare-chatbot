Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  These measures, and sometimes others, may be combined into composite risk scores to estimate an individual's future risk of cardiovascular disease.  Numerous risk scores exist although their respective merits are debated.  Other diagnostic tests and biomarkers remain under evaluation but currently these lack clear-cut evidence to support their routine use.  They include family history, coronary artery calcification score, high sensitivity C-reactive protein , ankleâ€“brachial pressure index,  lipoprotein subclasses and particle concentration, lipoprotein, apolipoproteins A-I and B, fibrinogen, white blood cell count, homocysteine, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide  , and markers of kidney function.  High blood phosphorus is also linked to an increased risk. There is evidence that mental health problems, in particular depression and traumatic stress, is linked to cardiovascular diseases.  Whereas mental health problems are known to be associated with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as smoking, poor diet, and a sedentary lifestyle, these factors alone do not explain the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases seen in depression, stress, and anxiety Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
