Cancer Cancer  One accepted source is frequent, long-term application of hot objects to the body.  It is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body, such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters , may produce skin cancer, especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present.  Frequent consumption of scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer.  Generally, it is believed that cancer arises, or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged, during the process of healing, rather than directly by the trauma.  However, repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation, which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation. Chronic inflammation has been hypothesized to directly cause mutation.  Inflammation can contribute to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing the tumor microenvironment Cancer Cancer
