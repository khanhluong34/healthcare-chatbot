Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  For newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers: hepatitis B vaccine alone, hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone, or the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin, all prevent hepatitis B occurrence.  Furthermore, the combination of vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin is superior to vaccine alone.  This combination prevents HBV transmission around the time of birth in 86% to 99% of cases. Tenofovir given in the second or third trimester can reduce the risk of mother to child transmission by 77% when combined with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and the hepatitis B vaccine, especially for pregnant women with high hepatitis B virus DNA levels.  However, there is no sufficient evidence that the administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone during pregnancy, might reduce transmission rates to the newborn infant.  No randomized control trial has been conducted to assess the effects of hepatitis B vaccine during pregnancy for preventing infant infection. All those with a risk of exposure to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
