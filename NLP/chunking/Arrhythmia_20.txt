Arrhythmia Arrhythmia   It is used for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias.  In elective cardioversion, the recipient is usually sedated or lightly anesthetized for the procedure. Defibrillation differs in that the shock is not synchronized.   It is needed for the chaotic rhythm of ventricular fibrillation and is also used for pulseless ventricular tachycardia.  Often, more electricity is required for defibrillation than for cardioversion.  In most defibrillation, the recipient has lost consciousness so there is no need for sedation. Defibrillation or cardioversion may be accomplished by an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator  Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
