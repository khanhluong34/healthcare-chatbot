Influenza Influenza  Annual vaccination can help to provide protection against influenza.  Influenza viruses, particularly IAV, evolve quickly, so flu vaccines are updated regularly to match which influenza strains are in circulation.  Vaccines provide protection against IAV subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and one or two IBV subtypes.  Influenza infection is diagnosed with laboratory methods such as  antibody or antigen tests and a polymerase chain reaction  to identify viral nucleic acid.  The disease can be treated with supportive measures and, in severe cases, with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir.  In healthy individuals, influenza is typically self-limiting and rarely fatal, but it can be deadly in high-risk groups. In a typical year, 5â€“15% of the population contracts influenza Influenza Influenza
