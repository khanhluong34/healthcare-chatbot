Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease Complementary and alternative medicine approaches have been used in inflammatory bowel disorders.  Evidence from controlled studies of these therapies has been reviewed; risk of bias was quite heterogeneous.  The best supportive evidence was found for herbal therapy, with Plantago ovata and curcumin in UC maintenance therapy, wormwood in CD, mind/body therapy and self-intervention in UC, and acupuncture in UC and CD. Stem cell therapy is undergoing research as a possible treatment for IBD.  A review of studies suggests a promising role, although there are substantial challenges, including cost and characterization of effects, which limit the current use in clinical practice. Currently, there is no evidence to recommend psychological treatment, such as psychotherapy, stress management and patient's education, to all adults with IBD in general.  These treatments had no effect on quality of life, emotional well-being and disease activity Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
