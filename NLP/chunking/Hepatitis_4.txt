Hepatitis Hepatitis Fulminant hepatitis, or massive hepatic cell death, is a rare and life-threatening complication of acute hepatitis that can occur in cases of hepatitis B, D, and E, in addition to drug-induced and autoimmune hepatitis.  The complication more frequently occurs in instances of hepatitis B and D co-infection at a rate of 2–20% and in pregnant women with hepatitis E at rate of 15–20% of cases.  In addition to the signs of acute hepatitis, people can also demonstrate signs of coagulopathy  and encephalopathy .  Mortality due to fulminant hepatitis is typically the result of various complications including cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, respiratory failure, or kidney failure. Acute cases of hepatitis are seen to be resolved well within a six-month period.  When hepatitis is continued for more than six months it is termed chronic hepatitis.  Chronic hepatitis is often asymptomatic early in its course and is detected only by liver laboratory studies for screening purposes or to evaluate non-specific symptoms Hepatitis Hepatitis
