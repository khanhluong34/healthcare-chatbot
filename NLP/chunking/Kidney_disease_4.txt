Kidney disease Kidney disease Higher dietary intake of animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol may increase risk for microalbuminuria, a sign of kidney function decline, and generally, diets higher in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains but lower in meat and sweets may be protective against kidney function decline.  This may be because sources of animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol, and sweets are more acid-producing, while fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are more base-producing. IgA nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis throughout the world  Primary IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of the IgA antibody in the glomerulus.  The classic presentation  is episodic frank hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection  as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis which occurs some time  after initial infection.  Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent.  All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Kidney disease induced by iodinated contrast media  is called CIN  or contrast-induced AKI  Kidney disease Kidney disease
