Influenza Influenza  Spillover events from humans to pigs, however, appear to be more common than from pigs to humans. Influenza viruses have been found in many other animals, including cattle, horses, dogs, cats, and marine mammals.  Nearly all IAVs are apparently descended from ancestral viruses in birds.  The exception are bat influenza-like viruses, which have an uncertain origin.  These bat viruses have HA and NA subtypes H17, H18, N10, and N11.  H17N10 and H18N11 are unable to reassort with other IAVs, but they are still able to replicate in other mammals.  AIVs sometimes crossover into mammals Influenza Influenza
