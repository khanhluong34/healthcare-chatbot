Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Chronic infections by parasites account for a high morbidity and mortality in many underdeveloped countries. For infecting organisms to survive and repeat the infection cycle in other hosts, they  must leave an existing reservoir and cause infection elsewhere.  Infection transmission can take place via many potential routes:The relationship between virulence versus transmissibility is complex; with studies have shown that there were no clear relationship between the two.  There is still a small number of evidence that partially suggests a link between virulence and transmissibility. Diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly.  In practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts, cutaneous abscesses, respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent.  Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent, the presence of a microbe in a community, and other epidemiological considerations Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
