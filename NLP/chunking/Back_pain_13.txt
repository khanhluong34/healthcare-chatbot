This assumes that there is no reason to expect that the patient has an underlying problem.  In most cases, the pain subsides naturally after several weeks.  People who seek diagnosis through imaging are typically less likely to receive a better outcome than are those who wait for the condition to resolve. Magnetic resonance imaging  is the preferred modality for the evaluation of back pain and visualization of bone, soft tissue, nerves and ligaments Back pain Back pain
