Diabetes Diabetes There are a number of different classes of anti-diabetic medications.  Type 1 diabetes requires treatment with insulin, ideally using a "basal bolus" regimen that most closely matches normal insulin release: long-acting insulin for the basal rate and short-acting insulin with meals.  Type 2 diabetes is generally treated with medication that is taken by mouth  although some eventually require injectable treatment with insulin or GLP-1 agonists. Metformin is generally recommended as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.  It works by decreasing the liver's production of glucose, and increasing the amount of glucose stored in peripheral tissue.  Several other groups of drugs, mainly oral medication, may also decrease blood sugar in type 2 diabetes.  These include agents that increase insulin release , agents that decrease absorption of sugar from the intestines , agents that inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4  that inactivates incretins such as GLP-1 and GIP , agents that make the body more sensitive to insulin  and agents that increase the excretion of glucose in the urine  Diabetes Diabetes
