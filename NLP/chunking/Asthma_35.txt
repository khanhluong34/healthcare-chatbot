Asthma Asthma  However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.  For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.  There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.  There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma. Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.  Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.  Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush Asthma Asthma
