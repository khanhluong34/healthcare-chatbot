Influenza Influenza  The virion consists of each segment of the genome bound to nucleoproteins in separate ribonucleoprotein  complexes for each segment, all of which are surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane called the viral envelope.  There is a copy of the RdRp, all subunits included, bound to each RNP.  The envelope is reinforced structurally by matrix proteins on the interior that enclose the RNPs, and the envelope contains HA and NA  proteins extending outward from the exterior surface of the envelope.  HA and HEF proteins have a distinct "head" and "stalk" structure.  M2 proteins form proton ion channels through the viral envelope that are required for viral entry and exit.  IBVs contain a surface protein named NB that is anchored in the envelope, but its function is unknown. The viral life cycle begins by binding to a target cell Influenza Influenza
