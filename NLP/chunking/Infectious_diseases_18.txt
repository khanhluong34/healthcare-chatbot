Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Serological tests, if available, are usually the preferred route of identification, however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require refrigeration.  Some serological methods are extremely costly, although when commonly used, such as with the "strep test", they can be inexpensive. Complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as immunoassays.  Immunoassays can use the basic antibody â€“ antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro-magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation.  Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen.  To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent.  For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
