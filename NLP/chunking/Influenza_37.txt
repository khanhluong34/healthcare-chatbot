Influenza Influenza  Since the 2009 pandemic, oseltamivir resistance has mainly been observed in patients undergoing therapy, especially the immunocompromised and young children.  Oseltamivir resistance is usually reported in H1N1, but has been reported in H3N2 and IBVs less commonly.  Because of this, oseltamivir is recommended as the first drug of choice for immunocompetent people, whereas for the immunocompromised, oseltamivir is recommended against H3N2 and IBV and zanamivir against H1N1 pdm09.  Zanamivir resistance is observed less frequently, and resistance to peramivir and baloxavir marboxil is possible. In healthy individuals, influenza infection is usually self-limiting and rarely fatal.  Symptoms usually last for 2â€“8 days.  Influenza can cause people to miss work or school, and it is associated with decreased job performance and, in older adults, reduced independence Influenza Influenza
