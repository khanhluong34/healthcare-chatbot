Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease  The benefit from replacement with polyunsaturated fats appears greatest,  while replacement of saturated fats with carbohydrates does not appear to have a beneficial effect.  A diet high in trans fatty acids is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease, and in 2015 the Food and Drug Administration  determined that there was 'no longer a consensus among qualified experts that partially hydrogenated oils , which are the primary dietary source of industrially produced trans fatty acids , are generally recognized as safe  for any use in human food'.  There is conflicting evidence concerning whether dietary supplements of omega-3 fatty acids  added to diet improve cardiovascular risk. The benefits of recommending a low-salt diet in people with high or normal blood pressure are not clear.  In those with heart failure, after one study was left out, the rest of the trials show a trend to benefit.  Another review of dietary salt concluded that there is strong evidence that high dietary salt intake increases blood pressure and worsens hypertension, and that it increases the number of cardiovascular disease events; both as a result of the increased blood pressure and probably through other mechanisms.  Moderate evidence was found that high salt intake increases cardiovascular mortality; and some evidence was found for an increase in overall mortality, strokes, and left ventricular hypertrophy Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease
