Cancer Cancer  Such alterations may occur early in progression to cancer and are a possible cause of the genetic instability characteristic of cancers. Reduced expression of DNA repair genes disrupts DNA repair.  This is shown in the figure at the 4th level from the top.   When DNA repair is deficient DNA damage remains in cells at a higher than usual level  and causes increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation .  Mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair .  Chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy also increase in HRR defective cells. Higher levels of DNA damage cause increased mutation  and increased epimutation Cancer Cancer
