Migraine Migraine  If any symptom remains after 60 minutes, the state is known as prolonged aura. Visual disturbances often consist of a scintillating scotoma .  These typically start near the center of vision and then spread out to the sides with zigzagging lines which have been described as looking like fortifications or walls of a castle.  Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines.  Some people lose part of their field of vision known as hemianopsia while others experience blurring. Sensory aura are the second most common type; they occur in 30–40% of people with auras.  Often a feeling of pins-and-needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose–mouth area on the same side Migraine Migraine
