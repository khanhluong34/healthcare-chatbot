Hepatitis Hepatitis  In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x103 IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level.  In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment and evaluation for liver transplantation are recommended in all cases if HBV DNA is detectable.  Currently, multidrug treatment is not recommended in treatment of chronic HBV as it is no more effective in the long term than individual treatment with entecavir or tenofovir. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America  recommend antiviral treatment for all patients with chronic hepatitis C infection except for those with additional chronic medical conditions that limit their life expectancy. Once it is acquired, persistence of the hepatitis C virus is the rule, resulting in chronic hepatitis C.  The goal of treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma .  The best way to reduce the long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response  Hepatitis Hepatitis
