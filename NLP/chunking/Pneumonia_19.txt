Pneumonia Pneumonia  The respiratory rate may be faster than normal, and this may occur a day or two before other signs.  Examination of the chest may be normal, but it may show decreased expansion on the affected side.  Harsh breath sounds from the larger airways that are transmitted through the inflamed lung are termed bronchial breathing and are heard on auscultation with a stethoscope.  Crackles  may be heard over the affected area during inspiration.  Percussion may be dulled over the affected lung, and increased, rather than decreased, vocal resonance distinguishes pneumonia from a pleural effusion. A chest radiograph is frequently used in diagnosis.  In people with mild disease, imaging is needed only in those with potential complications, those not having improved with treatment, or those in which the cause is uncertain Pneumonia Pneumonia
