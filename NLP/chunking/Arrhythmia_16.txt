Arrhythmia Arrhythmia  Normally, the action potential impulse will spread through the heart quickly enough that each cell will respond only once.   However, if there is some essential heterogeneity of refractory period or if conduction is abnormally slow in some areas  so the myocardial cells are unable to activate the fast sodium channel, part of the impulse will arrive late and potentially be treated as a new impulse.  Depending on the timing, this can produce a sustained abnormal circuit rhythm. As a sort of re-entry, vortices of excitation in the myocardium  are considered to be the main mechanism of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  In particular, the autowave reverberator is common in the thin walls of the atria, sometimes resulting in atrial flutter.  Re-entry is also responsible for most paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and dangerous ventricular tachycardia.  These types of re-entry circuits are different from WPW syndromes, which utilize abnormal conduction pathways Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
