Hepatitis Hepatitis  First-line therapy for GT1 is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir  for 12 weeks for most patients, including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.  Certain patients with early disease need only 8 weeks of treatment while those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have not responded to prior treatment require 24 weeks.  Cost remains a major factor limiting access to these drugs, particularly in low-resource nations; the cost of the 12-week GT1 regimen   has been estimated at US$94,500. Hepatitis D is difficult to treat, and effective treatments are lacking.  Interferon alpha has proven effective at inhibiting viral activity but only on a temporary basis. Similar to hepatitis A, treatment of hepatitis E is supportive and includes rest and ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration.  Hospitalization may be required for particularly severe cases or for pregnant women Hepatitis Hepatitis
