Arrhythmia Arrhythmia Congenital heart defects are structural or electrical pathway problems in the heart that are present at birth.   Anyone can be affected by this because overall health does not play a role in the problem.   Problems with the electrical pathway of the heart can cause very fast or even deadly arrhythmias.   Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome is due to an extra pathway in the heart that is made up of electrical muscle tissue.   This tissue allows the electrical impulse, which stimulates the heartbeat, to happen very rapidly.   Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia is the most common type of ventricular tachycardia in otherwise healthy individuals.   This defect is due to an electrical node in the right ventricle just before the pulmonary artery Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
