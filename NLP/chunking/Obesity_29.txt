Obesity Obesity  The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y  and agouti-related peptide  and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH.  The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin  and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript  and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH.  Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding.  Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated in part by leptin.  Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group.  Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity. The main treatment for obesity consists of weight loss via lifestyle interventions, including prescribed diets and physical exercise Obesity Obesity
