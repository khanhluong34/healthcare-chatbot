Diabetes Diabetes  A number of skin rashes that can occur in diabetes are collectively known as diabetic dermadromes. People with diabetes  may also experience diabetic ketoacidosis , a metabolic disturbance characterized by nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, the smell of acetone on the breath, deep breathing known as Kussmaul breathing, and in severe cases a decreased level of consciousness.  DKA requires emergency treatment in hospital.  A rarer but more dangerous condition is hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state , which is more common in type 2 diabetes and is mainly the result of dehydration caused by high blood sugars. Treatment-related low blood sugar  is common in people with type 1 and also type 2 diabetes depending on the medication being used.  Most cases are mild and are not considered medical emergencies.  Effects can range from feelings of unease, sweating, trembling, and increased appetite in mild cases to more serious effects such as confusion, changes in behavior such as aggressiveness, seizures, unconsciousness, and rarely permanent brain damage or death in severe cases Diabetes Diabetes
