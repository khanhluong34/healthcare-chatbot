The most common parasites implicated are Angiostrongylus cantonensis, Gnathostoma spinigerum, Schistosoma, as well as the conditions cysticercosis, toxocariasis, baylisascariasis, paragonimiasis, and a number of rarer infections and noninfective conditions. Rarely, free-living parasitic amoebae can cause Naegleriasis also called amebic meningitis  a type of meningoencephalitis where not only the meninges are affected but also the brain tissue. Meningitis may occur as the result of several non-infectious causes: spread of cancer to the meninges  and certain drugs  Meningitis Meningitis
