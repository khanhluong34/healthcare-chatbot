Influenza Influenza  The IAV subtypes in circulation as of 2018 are H1N1 and H3N2.  IAVs can be classified more specifically by natural host species, geographical origin, year of isolation, and strain number, such as H1N1/A/duck/Alberta/35/76. IBV mainly infects humans but has been identified in seals, horses, dogs, and pigs.  IBV does not have subtypes like IAV but has two antigenically distinct lineages, termed the B/Victoria/2/1987-like and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like lineages, or simply Victoria and Yamagata.  Both lineages are in circulation in humans, disproportionately affecting children.  IBVs contribute to seasonal epidemics alongside IAVs but have never been associated with a pandemic. ICV, like IBV, is primarily found in humans, though it also has been detected in pigs, feral dogs, dromedary camels, cattle, and dogs Influenza Influenza
