Hepatitis Hepatitis The largest outbreak of hepatitis A virus in United States history occurred among people who ate at a now-defunct Mexican food restaurant located in Monaca, Pennsylvania in late 2003.  Over 550 people who visited the restaurant between September and October 2003 were infected with the virus, three of whom died as a direct result.  The outbreak was brought to the attention of health officials when local emergency medicine physicians noticed a significant increase in  cases of hepatitis A in the county.  After conducting its investigation, the CDC attributed the source of the outbreak to the use of contaminated raw green onion.  The restaurant was purchasing its green onion stock from farms in Mexico at the time.  It is believed that the green onions may have been contaminated through the use of contaminated water for crop irrigation, rinsing, or icing or by handling of the vegetables by infected people.  Green onion had caused similar outbreaks of hepatitis A in the southern United States prior to this, but not to the same magnitude Hepatitis Hepatitis
