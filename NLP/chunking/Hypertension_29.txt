Hypertension Hypertension  Electrical therapies that stimulate the baroreflex are being studied as an option for lowering blood pressure in people in this situation. Some common secondary causes of resistant hypertension include obstructive sleep apnea, pheochromocytoma, renal artery stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, and primary aldosteronism.  As many as one in five people with resistant hypertension have primary aldosteronism, which is a treatable and sometimes curable condition. Refractory hypertension is characterized by uncontrolled elevated blood pressure unmitigated by five or more antihypertensive agents of different classes, including a long-acting thiazide-like diuretic, a calcium channel blocker, and a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system.  People with refractory hypertension typically have increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and are at high risk for more severe cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality. Non-modulating essential hypertension is a form of salt-sensitive hypertension, where sodium intake does not modulate either adrenal or renal vascular responses to angiotensin II.  Individuals with this subset have been termed non-modulators Hypertension Hypertension
