Pneumonia Pneumonia The addition of corticosteroids to standard antibiotic treatment appears to improve outcomes, reducing death and morbidity for adults with severe community acquired pneumonia, and reducing death for adults and children with non-severe community acquired pneumonia.  A 2017 review therefore recommended them in adults with severe community acquired pneumonia.  A 2019 guideline however recommended against their general use, unless refractory shock was present.  Side effects associated with the use of corticosteroids include high blood sugar.  There is some evidence that adding corticosteroids to the standard PCP pneumonia treatment may be beneficial for people who are infected with HIV. The use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor  along with antibiotics does not appear to reduce mortality and routine use for treating pneumonia is not supported by evidence. Neuraminidase inhibitors may be used to treat viral pneumonia caused by influenza viruses  Pneumonia Pneumonia
