The US Surgeon General stated in 1999 that: "Powerful and pervasive, stigma prevents people from acknowledging their own mental health problems, much less disclosing them to others. " Additionally, researcher Wulf RÃ¶ssler in 2016, in his article, "The Stigma of Mental Disorders" stated"For millennia, society did not treat persons suffering from depression, autism, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses much better than slaves or criminals: they were imprisoned, tortured or killed". In the United States, racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to experience mental health disorders often due to low socioeconomic status, and discrimination.

Employment discrimination is reported to play a significant part in the high rate of unemployment among those with a diagnosis of mental illness.  An Australian study found that having a psychiatric disability is a bigger barrier to employment than a physical disability Mental illness Mental illness
