Arrhythmia Arrhythmia   Although the goal of drug therapy is to prevent arrhythmia, nearly every antiarrhythmic drug has the potential to act as a pro-arrhythmic, and so must be carefully selected and used under medical supervision. Several groups of drugs slow conduction through the heart, without actually preventing an arrhythmia.   These drugs can be used to "rate control" a fast rhythm and make it physically tolerable for the patient. Some arrhythmias promote blood clotting within the heart and increase the risk of embolus and stroke.   Anticoagulant medications such as warfarin and heparins, and anti-platelet drugs such as aspirin can reduce the risk of clotting. Arrhythmias may also be treated electrically, by applying a shock across the heart – either externally to the chest wall, or internally to the heart via implanted electrodes. Cardioversion is either achieved pharmacologically or via the application of a shock synchronized to the underlying heartbeat Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
