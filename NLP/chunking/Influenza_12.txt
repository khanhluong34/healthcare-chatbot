Influenza Influenza  Binding is mediated by the viral HA proteins on the surface of the envelope, which bind to cells that contain sialic acid receptors on the surface of the cell membrane.  For N1 subtypes with the "G147R" mutation and N2 subtypes, the NA protein can initiate entry.  Prior to binding, NA proteins promote access to target cells by degrading mucus, which helps to remove extracellular decoy receptors that would impede access to target cells.  After binding, the virus is internalized into the cell by an endosome that contains the virion inside it.  The endosome is acidified by cellular vATPase to have lower pH, which triggers a conformational change in HA that allows fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane.  At the same time, hydrogen ions diffuse into the virion through M2 ion channels, disrupting internal protein-protein interactions to release RNPs into the host cell's cytosol.  The M1 protein shell surrounding RNPs is degraded, fully uncoating RNPs in the cytosol Influenza Influenza
