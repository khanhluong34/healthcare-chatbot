Arrhythmia Arrhythmia In adults, the normal resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 90 beats per minute.  The resting heart rate in children is much faster.  In athletes, however, the resting heart rate can be as slow as 40 beats per minute, and be considered normal. The term sinus arrhythmia refers to a normal phenomenon of alternating mild acceleration and slowing of the heart rate that occurs with breathing in and out respectively.   It is usually quite pronounced in children and steadily decreases with age.  This can also be present during meditation breathing exercises that involve deep inhaling and breath holding patterns. A slow rhythm  is labelled bradycardia Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
