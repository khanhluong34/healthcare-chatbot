Asthma Asthma  In contrast to emphysema, asthma affects the bronchi, not the alveoli.  The combination of asthma with a component of irreversible airway obstruction has been termed the asthma-chronic obstructive disease  overlap syndrome .  Compared to other people with "pure" asthma or COPD, people with ACOS exhibit increased morbidity, mortality and possibly more comorbidities. An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an asthma attack.  The classic symptoms are shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness.  The wheezing is most often when breathing out.  While these are the primary symptoms of asthma, some people present primarily with coughing, and in severe cases, air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard Asthma Asthma
