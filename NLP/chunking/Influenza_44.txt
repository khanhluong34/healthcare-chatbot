Influenza Influenza IAV and IBV co-circulate, so the two have the same patterns of transmission.  The seasonality of ICV, however, is poorly understood.  ICV infection is most common in children under the age of 2, and by adulthood most people have been exposed to it.  ICV-associated hospitalization most commonly occurs in children under the age of 3 and is frequently accompanied by co-infection with another virus or a bacterium, which may increase the severity of disease.  When considering all hospitalizations for respiratory illness among young children, ICV appears to account for only a small percentage of such cases.  Large outbreaks of ICV infection can occur, so incidence varies significantly. Outbreaks of influenza caused by novel influenza viruses are common Influenza Influenza
