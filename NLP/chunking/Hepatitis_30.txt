Hepatitis Hepatitis  As of March 2016, the United States government was in the process of recruiting participants for the phase IV trial of the hepatitis E vaccine. Because hepatitis A is transmitted primarily through the oral-fecal route, the mainstay of prevention aside from vaccination is good hygiene, access to clean water and proper handling of sewage. As hepatitis B and C are transmitted through blood and multiple bodily fluids, prevention is aimed at screening blood prior to transfusion, abstaining from the use of injection drugs, safe needle and sharps practices in healthcare settings, and safe sex practices. The hepatitis D virus requires that a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B.  In people who have chronic hepatitis B infection and are at risk for superinfection with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B. Hepatitis E is spread primarily through the oral-fecal route but may also be spread by blood and from mother to fetus.   The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention is similar to that for hepatitis A  Hepatitis Hepatitis
