Hepatitis E Hepatitis E  that 10% of pork sausages contained the hepatitis E virus.  Some research suggests that food must reach a temperature of 70 °C  for 20 minutes to eliminate the risk of infection.  The Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency discovered hepatitis E in almost half of all pigs in Scotland. Hepatitis E infection appeared to be more common in people on hemodialysis, although the specific risk factors for transmission are not clear. Hepatitis E due to genotypes other than 1 and 2 is thought to be a zoonosis, in that animals are thought to be the primary reservoir; deer and swine have frequently been implicated.  Domestic animals have been reported as a reservoir for the hepatitis E virus, with some surveys showing infection rates exceeding 95% among domestic pigs. 
Replicative virus has been found in the small intestine, lymph nodes, colon, and liver of experimentally infected pigs Hepatitis E Hepatitis E
