Arrhythmia Arrhythmia The method of cardiac rhythm management depends firstly on whether the affected person is stable or unstable.  Treatments may include physical maneuvers, medications, electricity conversion, or electro- or cryo-cautery. In the United States, people admitted to the hospital with cardiac arrhythmia and conduction disorders with and without complications were admitted to the intensive care unit more than half the time in 2011. Several physical acts can increase parasympathetic nervous supply to the heart, resulting in blocking of electrical conduction through the AV node.   This can slow down or stop several arrhythmias that originate above or at the AV node .   Parasympathetic nervous supply to the heart is via the vagus nerve, and these maneuvers are collectively known as vagal maneuvers. There are many classes of antiarrhythmic medications, with different mechanisms of action and many different individual drugs within these classes Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
