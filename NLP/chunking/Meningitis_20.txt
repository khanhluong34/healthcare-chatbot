Meningitis Meningitis 6  is therefore considered abnormal.  High levels of lactate in CSF indicate a higher likelihood of bacterial meningitis, as does a higher white blood cell count.  If lactate levels are less than 35Â mg/dl and the person has not previously received antibiotics then this may rule out bacterial meningitis. Various other specialized tests may be used to distinguish between different types of meningitis.  A latex agglutination test may be positive in meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and group B streptococci; its routine use is not encouraged as it rarely leads to changes in treatment, but it may be used if other tests are not diagnostic.  Similarly, the limulus lysate test may be positive in meningitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria, but it is of limited use unless other tests have been unhelpful.  Polymerase chain reaction  is a technique used to amplify small traces of bacterial DNA in order to detect the presence of bacterial or viral DNA in cerebrospinal fluid; it is a highly sensitive and specific test since only trace amounts of the infecting agent's DNA is required Meningitis Meningitis
