MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures.   Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin. Autoimmune encephalitis signs can include catatonia, psychosis, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation.  Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and Rasmussen encephalitis are examples of autoimmune encephalitis Encephalitis Encephalitis
