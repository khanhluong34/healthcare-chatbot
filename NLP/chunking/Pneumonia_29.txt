Pneumonia Pneumonia Smoking cessation and reducing indoor air pollution, such as that from cooking indoors with wood, crop residues or dung, are both recommended.  Smoking appears to be the single biggest risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia in otherwise-healthy adults.  Hand hygiene and coughing into one's sleeve may also be effective preventative measures.  Wearing surgical masks by the sick may also prevent illness. Appropriately treating underlying illnesses  can decrease the risk of pneumonia.  In children less than 6Â months of age, exclusive breast feeding reduces both the risk and severity of disease.  In people with HIV/AIDS and a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/uL the antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole decreases the risk of Pneumocystis pneumonia and is also useful for prevention in those that are immunocompromised but do not have HIV Pneumonia Pneumonia
