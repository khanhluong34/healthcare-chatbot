Influenza Influenza  Terms such as influenza di freddo, meaning "influence of the cold", and influenza di stelle, meaning "influence of the stars" are attested from the 14th century.  The latter referred to the disease's cause, which at the time was ascribed by some to unfavorable astrological conditions.  As early as 1504, influenza began to mean a "visitation" or "outbreak" of any disease affecting many people in a single place at once.  During an outbreak of influenza in 1743 that started in Italy and spread throughout Europe, the word reached the English language and was anglicized in pronunciation.  Since the mid-1800s, influenza has also been used to refer to severe colds.  The shortened form of the word, " flu", is first attested in 1839 as flue with the spelling flu confirmed in 1893.  Other names that have been used for influenza include epidemic catarrh, la grippe from French, sweating sickness, and, especially when referring to the 1918 pandemic strain, Spanish fever Influenza Influenza
