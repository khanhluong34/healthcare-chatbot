Pneumonia in children may additionally be classified based on signs and symptoms as non-severe, severe, or very severe. The setting in which pneumonia develops is important to treatment, as it correlates to which pathogens are likely suspects, which mechanisms are likely, which antibiotics are likely to work or fail, and which complications can be expected based on the person's health status. Community-acquired pneumonia  is acquired in the community, outside of health care facilities.  Compared with healthcare-associated pneumonia, it is less likely to involve multidrug-resistant bacteria.  Although the latter are no longer rare in CAP, they are still less likely.  Prior stays in healthcare-related environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, or hemodialysis centers or a history of receiving domiciliary care can increase patientsâ€™ risk for CAP caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria Pneumonia Pneumonia
