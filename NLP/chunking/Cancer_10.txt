Cancer Cancer  The typical steps in metastasis are local invasion, intravasation into the blood or lymph, circulation through the body, extravasation into the new tissue, proliferation and angiogenesis.  Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain, and the bones. The majority of cancers, some 90–95% of cases, are due to genetic mutations from environmental and lifestyle factors.  The remaining 5–10% are due to inherited genetics.
