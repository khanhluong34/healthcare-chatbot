Hepatitis B Hepatitis B During HBV infection, the host immune response causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance.  Although the innate immune response does not play a significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection.  CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes.  Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver. The tests, called assays, for detection of hepatitis B virus infection involve serum or blood tests that detect either viral antigens  or antibodies produced by the host.  Interpretation of these assays is complex. The hepatitis B surface antigen  is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
