Cancer Cancer  Oncogenes build up an inflammatory pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Some hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation.  Insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis. Hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers, such as cancer of the breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary and testis and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer.  For example, the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer.  These higher hormone levels may explain their higher risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene.  Similarly, men of African ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of European ancestry and have a correspondingly higher level of prostate cancer Cancer Cancer
