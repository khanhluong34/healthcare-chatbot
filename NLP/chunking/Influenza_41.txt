Influenza Influenza  The role of genetics in influenza is not well researched, but it may be a factor in influenza mortality. Influenza is typically characterized by seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics.  Most of the burden of influenza is a result of flu seasons caused by IAV and IBV.  Among IAV subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2 circulate in humans and are responsible for seasonal influenza.  Cases disproportionately occur in children, but most severe causes are among the elderly, the very young, and the immunocompromised.  In a typical year, influenza viruses infect 5–15% of the global population, causing 3–5 million cases of severe illness annually and accounting for 290,000–650,000 deaths each year due to respiratory illness.  5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children contract influenza each year Influenza Influenza
