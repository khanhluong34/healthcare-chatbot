Migraine Migraine Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to a migraine headache include temporal arteritis, cluster headaches, acute glaucoma, meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Temporal arteritis typically occurs in people over 50 years old and presents with tenderness over the temple, cluster headache presents with one-sided nose stuffiness, tears and severe pain around the orbits, acute glaucoma is associated with vision problems, meningitis with fevers, and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a very fast onset.  Tension headaches typically occur on both sides, are not pounding, and are less disabling. Those with stable headaches that meet criteria for migraines should not receive neuroimaging to look for other intracranial disease.  This requires that other concerning findings such as papilledema  are not present.  People with migraines are not at an increased risk of having another cause for severe headaches. Preventive treatments of migraine include medications, nutritional supplements, lifestyle alterations, and surgery Migraine Migraine
