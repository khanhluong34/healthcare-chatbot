Serum IgM and IgG antibodies against HEV appear just before the onset of clinical symptoms.  Recovery leads to virus clearance from the blood, while the virus may persist in stool for much longer.  Recovery is also marked by disappearance of IgM antibodies and increase of levels of IgG antibodies. While usually lasting weeks and then resolving, in people with weakened immune systems—particularly in people who have had solid organ transplant—hepatitis E may cause a chronic infection.  Occasionally this may result in a life-threatening illness such as fulminant liver failure or liver cirrhosis.
