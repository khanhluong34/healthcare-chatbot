Hepatitis Hepatitis The treatment of hepatitis varies according to the type, whether it is acute or chronic, and the severity of the disease. Hepatitis A usually does not progress to a chronic state, and rarely requires hospitalization.  Treatment is supportive and includes such measures as providing intravenous  hydration and maintaining adequate nutrition. Rarely, people with the hepatitis A virus can rapidly develop liver failure, termed fulminant hepatic failure, especially the elderly and those who had a pre-existing liver disease, especially hepatitis C.  Mortality risk factors include greater age and chronic hepatitis C.  In these cases, more aggressive supportive therapy and liver transplant may be necessary. In healthy patients, 95â€“99% recover with no long-lasting effects, and antiviral treatment is not warranted Hepatitis Hepatitis
