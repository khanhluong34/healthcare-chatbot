Kidney disease Kidney disease  Currently, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.  But there is a body of evidence that several factors including apoptosis-induction seem to play a role. Lithium, a medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorders, can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus; its long-term use can lead to nephropathy. Despite expensive treatments, lupus nephritis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with relapsing or refractory lupus nephritis. Another possible cause of Kidney disease is due to decreased function of xanthine oxidase in the purine degradation pathway.  Xanthine oxidase will degrade hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid.  Xanthine is not very soluble in water; therefore, an increase in xanthine forms crystals  and result in damage to the kidney Kidney disease Kidney disease
