It is even speculated that an effective "immunization" procedure could be developedâ€”by ingesting the cocktail at an early age.

Currently, there is evidence to support the use of certain probiotics in addition to standard treatments in people with ulcerative colitis but there is no sufficient data to recommend probiotics in people with Crohn's disease.  Both single strain and multi-strain probiotics have been researched for mild to moderate cases of ulcerative colitis.   The most clinically researched multi-strain probiotic with over 70 human trials is the De Simone Formulation.   Further research is required to identify specific probiotic strains or their combinations and prebiotic substances for therapies of intestinal inflammation Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
