Migraine is believed to be primarily a neurological disorder, while others believe it to be a neurovascular disorder with blood vessels playing the key role, although current evidence does not support this completely.  Others believe both are likely important.  One theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem. Cortical spreading depression, or spreading depression according to Le√£o, is a burst of neuronal activity followed by a period of inactivity, which is seen in those with migraines with aura.  There are a number of explanations for its occurrence, including activation of NMDA receptors leading to calcium entering the cell.  After the burst of activity, the blood flow to the cerebral cortex in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours Migraine Migraine
