Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease  Fecal calprotectin is useful as an initial investigation, which may suggest the possibility of IBD, as this test is sensitive but not specific for IBD. Other diseases may cause an increased excretion of fecal calprotectin, such as infectious diarrhea, untreated celiac disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal cystic fibrosis and neoplastic pediatric tumor cells. Conditions with similar symptoms as Crohn's disease includes intestinal tuberculosis, Beh√ßet's disease, ulcerative colitis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy, irritable bowel syndrome and coeliac disease. Conditions with similar symptoms as ulcerative colitis includes acute self-limiting colitis, amebic colitis, schistosomiasis, Crohn's disease, colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal tuberculosis and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug enteropathy. Liver function tests are often elevated in inflammatory bowel disease, and are often mild and generally return spontaneously to normal levels.  The most relevant mechanisms of elevated liver functions tests in IBD are drug-induced hepatotoxicity and fatty liver. The chief types of inflammatory bowel disease are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis  Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease
