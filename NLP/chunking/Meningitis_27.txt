Meningitis Meningitis Mechanical ventilation may be needed if the level of consciousness is very low, or if there is evidence of respiratory failure.  If there are signs of raised intracranial pressure, measures to monitor the pressure may be taken; this would allow the optimization of the cerebral perfusion pressure and various treatments to decrease the intracranial pressure with medication .  Seizures are treated with anticonvulsants.  Hydrocephalus  may require insertion of a temporary or long-term drainage device, such as a cerebral shunt.  The osmotic therapy, glycerol, has an unclear effect on mortality but may decrease hearing problems. Empiric antibiotics  should be started immediately, even before the results of the lumbar puncture and CSF analysis are known.  The choice of initial treatment depends largely on the kind of bacteria that cause meningitis in a particular place and population Meningitis Meningitis
