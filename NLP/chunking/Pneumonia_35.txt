Pneumonia Pneumonia  In children with mild or moderate symptoms, amoxicillin taken by mouth is the first line.  The use of fluoroquinolones in uncomplicated cases is discouraged due to concerns about side-effects and generating resistance in light of there being no greater benefit. For those who require hospitalization and caught their pneumonia in the community the use of a Î²-lactam such as cephazolin plus a macrolide such as azithromycin is recommended.  A fluoroquinolone may replace azithromycin but is less preferred.  Antibiotics by mouth and by injection appear to be similarly effective in children with severe pneumonia. The duration of treatment has traditionally been seven to ten days, but increasing evidence suggests that shorter courses  may be effective for certain types of pneumonia and may reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.  Research in children showed that a shorter, 3-day course of amoxicillin was as effective as a longer, 7-day course for treating pneumonia in this population Pneumonia Pneumonia
