Arrhythmia Arrhythmia   When the node is stimulated, the patient will go into ventricular tachycardia, which does not allow the heart to fill with blood before beating again.   Long QT syndrome is another complex problem in the heart and has been labeled as an independent factor in mortality.     There are multiple methods of treatment for these including cardiac ablations, medication treatment, or lifestyle changes to have less stress and exercise. Automaticity refers to a cardiac muscle cell firing off an impulse on its own.   All of the cells in the heart have the ability to initiate an action potential; however, only some of these cells are designed to routinely trigger heartbeats.   These cells are found in the conduction system of the heart and include the SA node, AV node, Bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers.   The sinoatrial node is a single specialized location in the atrium that has a higher automaticity  than the rest of the heart and, therefore, is usually responsible for setting the heart rate and initiating each heartbeat Arrhythmia Arrhythmia
