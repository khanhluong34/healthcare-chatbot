Cancer Cancer Metastasis is the spread of cancer to other locations in the body.  The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor.  Almost all cancers can metastasize.  Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized. Metastasis is common in the late stages of cancer and it can occur via the blood or the lymphatic system or both.  The typical steps in metastasis are local invasion, intravasation into the blood or lymph, circulation through the body, extravasation into the new tissue, proliferation and angiogenesis.  Different types of cancers tend to metastasize to particular organs, but overall the most common places for metastases to occur are the lungs, liver, brain and the bones Cancer Cancer
