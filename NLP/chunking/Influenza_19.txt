Influenza Influenza  Inhalation of aerosols can lead to infection, but most transmission is in the area about two meters around an infected person via respiratory droplets that come into contact with mucosa of the upper respiratory tract.  Transmission through contact with a person, bodily fluids, or intermediate objects  can also occur, such as through contaminated hands and surfaces since influenza viruses can survive for hours on non-porous surfaces.  If one's hands are contaminated, then touching one's face can cause infection. Influenza is usually transmissible from one day before the onset of symptoms to 5–7 days after.  In healthy adults, the virus is shed for up to 3–5 days.  In children and the immunocompromised, the virus may be transmissible for several weeks.  Children ages 2–17 are considered to be the primary and most efficient spreaders of influenza Influenza Influenza
