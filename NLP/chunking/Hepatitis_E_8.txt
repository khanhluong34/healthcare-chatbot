Hepatitis E Hepatitis E  Transmission after consumption of wild boar meat and uncooked deer meat has been reported as well.   The rate of transmission to humans by this route and the public health importance of this are, however, still unclear.  Other animal reservoirs are possible but unknown at this timeA number of other small mammals have been identified as potential reservoirs: the lesser bandicoot rat , the black rat  and the Asian house shrew .  A new virus designated rat hepatitis E virus has been isolated. HEV has three open reading frames  encoding two polyproteins .  ORF2 encodes three capsid proteins whereas O1 encodes seven fragments involved in viral replication, among others. The smallest ORF of the HEV genome, ORF3 is translated from a subgenomic RNA into O3, a protein of 113â€“115 amino acids Hepatitis E Hepatitis E
