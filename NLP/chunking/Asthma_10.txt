Asthma Asthma  By the end of 2005, 25 genes had been associated with asthma in six or more separate populations, including GSTM1, IL10, CTLA-4, SPINK5, LTC4S, IL4R and ADAM33, among others.  Many of these genes are related to the immune system or modulating inflammation.  Even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies, results have not been consistent among all populations tested.  In 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma in one genetic association study alone; more continue to be found. Some genetic variants may only cause asthma when they are combined with specific environmental exposures.  An example is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD14 region and exposure to endotoxin .  Endotoxin exposure can come from several environmental sources including tobacco smoke, dogs, and farms Asthma Asthma
