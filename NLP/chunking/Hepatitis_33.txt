Hepatitis Hepatitis  Age and comorbid conditions can result in a more prolonged and severe illness.  Certain patients warrant hospitalization, especially those who present with clinical signs of ascites, peripheral edema, and hepatic encephalopathy, and laboratory signs of hypoglycemia, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin, and very high serum bilirubin. In these rare, more severe acute cases, patients have been successfully treated with antiviral therapy similar to that used in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or tenofovir.  As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate. Chronic hepatitis B management aims to control viral replication, which is correlated with progression of disease.  Seven drugs are approved in the United States:First-line treatments currently used include PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir, subject to patient and physician preference.  Treatment initiation is guided by recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases  and the European Association for the Study of the Liver  and is based on detectable viral levels, HBeAg positive or negative status, ALT levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy Hepatitis Hepatitis
