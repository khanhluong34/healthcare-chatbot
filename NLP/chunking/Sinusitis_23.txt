Sinusitis Sinusitis  Treatment options include non-surgical root canal treatment, periradicular surgery, tooth replantation, or extraction of the infected tooth.

Surgery should only be considered for those people who do not benefit with medication or have non-invasive fungal sinusitis.  It is unclear how benefits of surgery compare to medical treatments in those with nasal polyps as this has been poorly studied. A number of surgical approaches can be used to access the sinuses and these have generally shifted from external/extranasal approaches to intranasal endoscopic ones.   The benefit of functional endoscopic sinus surgery  is its ability to allow for a more targeted approach to the affected sinuses, reducing tissue disruption, and minimizing post-operative complications.
