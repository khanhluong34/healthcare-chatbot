Pneumonia Pneumonia  When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur.  Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation.  As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions.  Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can occur at the same time as viral pneumonia. Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.  In adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung examination, the diagnosis is unlikely.  However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial cause Pneumonia Pneumonia
