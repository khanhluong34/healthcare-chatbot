Cancer Cancer  The increased risk is believed to be due to the random chance of developing any cancer, the likelihood of surviving the first cancer, the same risk factors that produced the first cancer, unwanted side effects of treating the first cancer , and better compliance with screening. Predicting short- or long-term survival depends on many factors.  The most important are the cancer type and the patient's age and overall health.  Those who are frail with other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people.  Centenarians are unlikely to survive for five years even if treatment is successful.  People who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer.  People with lower quality of life may be affected by depression and other complications and/or disease progression that both impairs quality and quantity of life Cancer Cancer
