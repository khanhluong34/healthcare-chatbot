Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  Many of the most common primary pathogens of humans only infect humans, however, many serious diseases are caused by organisms acquired from the environment or that infect non-human hosts. Opportunistic pathogens can cause an infectious disease in a host with depressed resistance  or if they have unusual access to the inside of the body .  Opportunistic infection may be caused by microbes ordinarily in contact with the host, such as pathogenic bacteria or fungi in the gastrointestinal or the upper respiratory tract, and they may also result from  microbes acquired from other hosts  or from the environment as a result of traumatic introduction .  An opportunistic disease requires impairment of host defenses, which may occur as a result of genetic defects , exposure to antimicrobial drugs or immunosuppressive chemicals , exposure to ionizing radiation, or as a result of an infectious disease with immunosuppressive activity .  Primary pathogens may also cause more severe disease in a host with depressed resistance than would normally occur in an immunosufficient host. While a primary infection can practically be viewed as the root cause of an individual's current health problem, a secondary infection is a sequela or complication of that root cause.  For example, an infection due to a burn or penetrating trauma  is a secondary infection Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
