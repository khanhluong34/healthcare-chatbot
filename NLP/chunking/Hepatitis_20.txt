Hepatitis Hepatitis  In chronic Hepatitis B and C, natural killer cell function is impaired. Steatohepatitis is seen in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease and is the culmination of a cascade of events that began with injury.   In the case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation.  In alcoholic hepatitis, chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit.   Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free fatty acids  and their breakdown products  in the liver cells in a process called steatosis.  This initially reversible process overwhelms the hepatocyte's ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect  as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an oxidative stress response.   Over time, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the immune system via toll-like receptor 4  resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF that cause liver cell injury and death Hepatitis Hepatitis
