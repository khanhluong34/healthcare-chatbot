Migraine Migraine Migraine is divided into seven subclasses :Acephalgic migraine  is a relatively uncommon variant of migraine in which the patient experiences some migraine symptoms such as aura, nausea, photophobia, and hemiparesis, but does not experience headache Scintillating scotoma or visual migraine is distinct from retinal migraine.  It is a visual disturbance originating from the brain that may precede a migraine headache, but can also occur acephalgically. The diagnosis of abdominal migraine is controversial.  Some evidence indicates that recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the absence of a headache may be a type of migraine or are at least a precursor to migraines.  These episodes of pain may or may not follow a migraine-like prodrome and typically last minutes to hours.  They often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical migraine.  Other syndromes that are believed to be precursors include cyclical vomiting syndrome and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood Migraine Migraine
