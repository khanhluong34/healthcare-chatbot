Pneumonia Pneumonia The typical signs and symptoms in children under five are fever, cough, and fast or difficult breathing.  Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses and may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly.  In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old.  More severe signs and symptoms in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness. Bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually result in similar symptoms.  Some causes are associated with classic, but non-specific, clinical characteristics.  Pneumonia caused by Legionella may occur with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or confusion Pneumonia Pneumonia
