Asthma Asthma Asthma is the result of chronic inflammation of the conducting zone of the airways , which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding smooth muscles.  This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing.  The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment.  Occasionally the airways themselves change.  Typical changes in the airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis.  Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands.  Other cell types involved include T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils Asthma Asthma
