Meningitis Meningitis  The most common cause of recurrent meningitis is a skull fracture, particularly fractures that affect the base of the skull or extend towards the sinuses and petrous pyramids.  Approximately 59% of recurrent meningitis cases are due to such anatomical abnormalities, 36% are due to immune deficiencies , and 5% are due to ongoing infections in areas adjacent to the meninges. Viruses that cause meningitis include enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus , varicella zoster virus , mumps virus, HIV, LCMV, Arboviruses , and the Influenza virus.  Mollaret's meningitis is a chronic recurrent form of herpes meningitis; it is thought to be caused by herpes simplex virus type 2. There are a number of risk factors for fungal meningitis, including the use of immunosuppressants , HIV/AIDS, and the loss of immunity associated with aging.  It is uncommon in those with a normal immune system but has occurred with medication contamination.  Symptom onset is typically more gradual, with headaches and fever being present for at least a couple of weeks before diagnosis Meningitis Meningitis
