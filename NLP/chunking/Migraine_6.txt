Migraine Migraine  Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has passed with a loss of position sense.  Other symptoms of the aura phase can include speech or language disturbances, world spinning, and less commonly motor problems.  Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic migraine, and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras.  Auditory hallucinations or delusions have also been described. Classically the headache is unilateral, throbbing, and moderate to severe in intensity.  It usually comes on gradually and is aggravated by physical activity during a migraine attack.  However, the effects of physical activity on migraine are complex, and some researchers have concluded that, while exercise can trigger migraine attacks, regular exercise may have a prophylactic effect and decrease frequency of attacks Migraine Migraine
