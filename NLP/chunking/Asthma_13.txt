Both viral and bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract can worsen the disease.

Asthma exacerbations in school‐aged children peak in autumn, shortly after children return to school.  This might reflect a combination of factors, including poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and altered immune tolerance.  There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations Asthma Asthma
