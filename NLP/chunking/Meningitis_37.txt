Meningitis Meningitis  Sub-Saharan Africa has been plagued by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis for over a century, leading to it being labeled the "meningitis belt".  Epidemics typically occur in the dry season , and an epidemic wave can last two to three years, dying out during the intervening rainy seasons.  Attack rates of 100–800 cases per 100,000 are encountered in this area, which is poorly served by medical care.  These cases are predominantly caused by meningococci.  The largest epidemic ever recorded in history swept across the entire region in 1996–1997, causing over 250,000 cases and 25,000 deaths. Meningococcal disease occurs in epidemics in areas where many people live together for the first time, such as army barracks during mobilization, university and college campuses and the annual Hajj pilgrimage.  Although the pattern of epidemic cycles in Africa is not well understood, several factors have been associated with the development of epidemics in the meningitis belt Meningitis Meningitis
