Gastritis Gastritis Mucous gland metaplasia, the reversible replacement of differentiated cells, occurs in the setting of severe damage of the gastric glands, which then waste away  and are progressively replaced by mucous glands.  Gastric ulcers may develop; it is unclear if they are the causes or the consequences.   Intestinal metaplasia typically begins in response to chronic mucosal injury in the antrum and may extend to the body.  Gastric mucosa cells change to resemble intestinal mucosa and may even assume absorptive characteristics.  Intestinal metaplasia is classified histologically as complete or incomplete.  With complete metaplasia, gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel mucosa, both histologically and functionally, with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides.  In incomplete metaplasia, the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large intestine and frequently exhibits dysplasia Gastritis Gastritis
