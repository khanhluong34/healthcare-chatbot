Influenza Influenza  The matrix protein  and membrane protein  share a segment, as do the non-structural protein  and the nuclear export protein .  For IAV and IBV, hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase  are encoded on one segment each, whereas ICV and IDV encode a hemagglutinin-esterase fusion  protein on one segment that merges the functions of HA and NA.  The final genome segment encodes the viral nucleoprotein .  Influenza viruses also encode various accessory proteins, such as PB1-F2 and PA-X, that are expressed through alternative open reading frames and which are important in host defense suppression, virulence, and pathogenicity. The virus particle, called a virion, is pleomorphic and varies between being filamentous, bacilliform, or spherical in shape.  Clinical isolates tend to be pleomorphic, whereas strains adapted to laboratory growth typically produce spherical virions.  Filamentous virions are about 250 nanometers  by 80 nm, bacilliform 120–250 by 95 nm, and spherical 120 nm in diameter Influenza Influenza
