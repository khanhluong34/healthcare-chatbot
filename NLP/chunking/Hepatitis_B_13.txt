Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  There is a myristyl group, which plays an important role in infection, on the amino-terminal end of the preS1 part of the large  protein.  In addition to that, N terminus of the L protein have virus attachment and capsid binding sites.  Because of that, the N termini of half of the L protein molecules are positioned outside the membrane and the other half positioned inside the membrane. The function of the protein coded for by gene X is not fully understood but it is associated with the development of liver cancer.  It stimulates genes that promote cell growth and inactivates growth regulating molecules. The life cycle of hepatitis B virus is complex.  Hepatitis B is one of a few known pararetroviruses: non-retroviruses that still use reverse transcription in their replication process Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
