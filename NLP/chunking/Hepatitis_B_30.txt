Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  Approximately 50% of overt carriers experience acute reactivation.  Males with baseline ALT of 200Â UL/L are three times more likely to develop a reactivation than people with lower levels.  Although reactivation can occur spontaneously, people who undergo chemotherapy have a higher risk.  Immunosuppressive drugs favor increased HBV replication while inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function in the liver.  The risk of reactivation varies depending on the serological profile; those with detectable HBsAg in their blood are at the greatest risk, but those with only antibodies to the core antigen are also at risk.  The presence of antibodies to the surface antigen, which are considered to be a marker of immunity, does not preclude reactivation.  Treatment with prophylactic antiviral drugs can prevent the serious morbidity associated with HBV disease reactivation Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
