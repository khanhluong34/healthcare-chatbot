Cancer Cancer  Approaches include antibodies, checkpoint therapy, and adoptive cell transfer. Laser therapy uses high-intensity light to treat cancer by shrinking or destroying tumors or precancerous growths.  Lasers are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers that are on the surface of the body or the lining of internal organs.  It is used to treat basal cell skin cancer and the very early stages of others like cervical, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and non-small cell lung cancer.  It is often combined with other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.  Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy , or interstitial laser photocoagulation, uses lasers to treat some cancers using hyperthermia, which uses heat to shrink tumors by damaging or killing cancer cells.  Laser are more precise than surgery and cause less damage, pain, bleeding, swelling, and scarring Cancer Cancer
