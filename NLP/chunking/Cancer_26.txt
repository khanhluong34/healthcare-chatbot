Cancer Cancer Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome.  Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains copies  of a small chromosomal locus, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material.  Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location.  A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter region of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product.  Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, leading to the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants. Replication of the data contained within the DNA of living cells will probabilistically result in some errors  Cancer Cancer
