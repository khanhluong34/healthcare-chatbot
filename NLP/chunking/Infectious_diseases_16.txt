Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinomycetota genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia. Biochemical tests used in the identification of infectious agents include the detection of metabolic or enzymatic products characteristic of a particular infectious agent.  Since bacteria ferment carbohydrates in patterns characteristic of their genus and species, the detection of fermentation products is commonly used in bacterial identification.  Acids, alcohols and gases are usually detected in these tests when bacteria are grown in selective liquid or solid media. The isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease.  For example, humans can make neither RNA replicases nor reverse transcriptase, and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic. , of specific types of viral infections Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
