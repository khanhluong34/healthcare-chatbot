Mental illness Mental illness  Some neurologists argue that classification will only be reliable and valid when based on neurobiological features rather than clinical interview, while others suggest that the differing ideological and practical perspectives need to be better integrated. The DSM and ICD approach remains under attack both because of the implied causality model and because some researchers believe it better to aim at underlying brain differences which can precede symptoms by many years. The high degree of comorbidity between disorders in categorical models such as the DSM and ICD have led some to propose dimensional models.  Studying comorbidity between disorders have demonstrated two latent  factors or dimensions in the structure of mental disorders that are thought to possibly reflect etiological processes.  These two dimensions reflect a distinction between internalizing disorders, such as mood or anxiety symptoms, and externalizing disorders such as behavioral or substance use symptoms.  A single general factor of psychopathology, similar to the g factor for intelligence, has been empirically supported.  The p factor model supports the internalizing-externalizing distinction, but also supports the formation of a third dimension of thought disorders such as schizophrenia Mental illness Mental illness
