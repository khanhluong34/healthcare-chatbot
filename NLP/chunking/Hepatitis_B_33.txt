In the United States, an estimated 0. 26% of the population was living with HBV infection as of 2018. Findings of HBV DNA in ancient human remains have shown that HBV has infected humans for at least ten millennia, both in Eurasia and in the Americas.  This disproved the belief that hepatitis B originated in the New World and spread to Europe around 16th century.  Hepatitis B virus subgenotype C4 is exclusively present in Australian aborigines, suggesting an ancient origin as much as 50,000 years old.  However, analyses of ancient HBV genomes suggested that the most recent common ancestor of all known human HBV strains was dated to between 20,000 and 12,000 years ago, pointing to a more recent origin for all HBV genotypes Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
