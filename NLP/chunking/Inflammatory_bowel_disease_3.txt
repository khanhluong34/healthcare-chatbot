Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease As a result of microbial symbiosis and immunity, alterations in the gut microbiome may contribute to inflammatory gut diseases.  IBD-affected individuals have been found to have 30–50 percent reduced biodiversity of commensal bacteria, such as decreases in Bacillota  and Bacteroidota.  Further evidence of the role of gut flora in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease is that IBD-affected individuals are more likely to have been prescribed antibiotics in the 2–5 year period before their diagnosis than unaffected individuals.  The enteral bacteria can be altered by environmental factors, such as concentrated milk fats  or oral medications such as antibiotics and oral iron preparations.  The mucosal microbiota in the large intestine of IBD patients with active inflammation was found to be associated with pro-inflammatory changes to the host epigenome.  However, large international studies have failed to identify a single microbial biomarker of IBD indicating it's not driven by any single micro-organism.
