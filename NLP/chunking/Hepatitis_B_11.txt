Hepatitis B Hepatitis B  One end of the full length strand is linked to the HBV DNA polymerase.  The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long  and 1700–2800 nucleotides long .  The negative-sense  is complementary to the viral mRNA.  The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell.  The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the  sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the  sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the  sense strand.  Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the  sense strand and the ends are rejoined.  There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S Hepatitis B Hepatitis B
