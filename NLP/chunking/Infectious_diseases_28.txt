Infectious diseases Infectious diseases  A nosocomial infection is also one that occurs in a health care setting.  Nosocomial infections are those that are acquired during a hospital stay.  Lastly, a community-acquired infection is one in which the infection is acquired from a whole community. One manner of proving that a given disease is infectious, is to satisfy Koch's postulates , which require that first, the infectious agent be identifiable only in patients who have the disease, and not in healthy controls, and second, that patients who contract the infectious agent also develop the disease.  These postulates were first used in the discovery that Mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis. However, Koch's postulates cannot usually be tested in modern practice for ethical reasons.  Proving them would require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture Infectious diseases Infectious diseases
