Hepatitis E Hepatitis E  For some of these reported conditions such as musculoskeletal or immune-mediated manifestations the relationship is not entirely clear, but for several neurological and blood conditions the relationship appears more consistent:Pregnant women show a more severe course of infection than other populations.  Liver failure with mortality rates of 20% to 25% has been reported from outbreaks of genotype 1 and 2 HEV in developing countries.  Besides signs of an acute infections, adverse effects on the mother and fetus may include preterm delivery, abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal death. The pathological and biological mechanisms behind the adverse outcomes of pregnancy infections remain largely unclear.  Increased viral replication and influence of hormonal changes on the immune system are currently thought to contribute to worsening the course of infection.  Furthermore, studies showing evidence for viral replication in the placenta or reporting the full viral life cycle in placental-derived cells in vitro suggest that the human placenta may be a site of viral replication outside the liver.  The primary reason for HEV severity in pregnancy remains enigmatic Hepatitis E Hepatitis E
