Influenza Influenza Aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls are the primary reservoir of IAVs.  In birds, AIVs may be either low pathogenic avian influenza  viruses that produce little to no symptoms or highly pathogenic avian influenza  viruses that cause severe illness.  Symptoms of HPAI infection include lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production, soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, swelling of the head, comb, wattles, and hocks, purple discoloration of wattles, combs, and legs, nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, incoordination, and diarrhea.  Birds infected with an HPAI virus may also die suddenly without any signs of infection. The distinction between LPAI and HPAI can generally be made based on how lethal an AIV is to chickens.  At the genetic level, an AIV can be usually be identified as an HPAI virus if it has a multibasic cleavage site in the HA protein, which contains additional residues in the HA gene.  Most AIVs are LPAI Influenza Influenza
