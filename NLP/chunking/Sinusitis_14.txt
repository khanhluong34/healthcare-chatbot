Sinusitis Sinusitis  Trials of antifungal treatments have had mixed results. Recent theories of sinusitis indicate that it often occurs as part of a spectrum of diseases that affect the respiratory tract  and is often linked to asthma. Both smoking and secondhand smoke are associated with chronic rhinosinusitis. Other diseases such as cystic fibrosis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis can also cause chronic sinusitis. Maxillary sinusitis may also develop from problems with the teeth, and these cases were calculated to be about 40% in one study and 50% in another.  The cause of this situation is usually a periapical or periodontal infection of a maxillary posterior tooth, where the inflammatory exudate has eroded through the bone superiorly to drain into the maxillary sinus.
