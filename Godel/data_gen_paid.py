def create_prompt(context):  
  return f"""
        I want you to generate multiple conversations related to a given context. The conversation is between the patient and the health-care chatbot called Medi. The conversation may be about one of following cases or can combine them or based on your imagination:
            The patient has some symptom in the context and needs help, Medi will give advice and diagnosis based on its knowledge obtained from the context.
            The patient just has some questions about the disease mentioned in the context and Medi gives the explanation for these questions.
            the patient has endured a medical procedure in the given context, Medi will give advice for lifestyle, diet, physical excerise based on its knowledge obtained from the context.
        You must write the output conversation in a following JSON format:

        {{
        "dialog": [patient's turn,
                   Medi's turn,
                   patient's turn,
                   Medi's turn,
                   patient's turn,
                   Medi's turn,
                   patient's turn,
                   Medi's turn,
                   last patient's turn],
        "knowledge": {context},
        "response": last Medi's turn
        }}

        The number of words in each turn of Medi and patient must not exceed 15 words no matter what. The conversation need not contain all the information in the context and should be as natural as possible. The replies of Medi and the patient must be simple and comprehensive for each other as much as possible.
        The last patient's turn must be a question relating to the given context and the response is the answer for last Medi's turn based on the given context 
        The dialog must contain 4 turns between Medi and patient

        The context is: #### {context} ####
        
        From the context, you must output a list of 3 dialogues in the following format:

        [dialogue 1, 
        dialogue 2,
        dialogue 3,
        ]

Many people with type 2 diabetes have evidence of prediabetes  before meeting the criteria for type 2 diabetes.

Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis, especially in children.  The standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2 - 8 days.
