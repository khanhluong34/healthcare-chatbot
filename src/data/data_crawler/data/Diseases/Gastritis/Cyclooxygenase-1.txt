In humans it is one of two cyclooxygenases.Cyclooxygenase  is the central enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway to prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. This protein was isolated more than 40 years ago and cloned in 1988.There are two isozymes of COX encoded by distinct gene products: a constitutive COX-1  and an inducible COX-2, which differ in their regulation of expression and tissue distribution. The expression of these two transcripts is differentially regulated by relevant cytokines and growth factors. This gene encodes COX-1, which regulates angiogenesis in endothelial cells. COX-1 is also involved in cell signaling and maintaining tissue homeostasis. A splice variant of COX-1 termed COX-3 was identified in the central nervous system of dogs, but does not result in a functional protein in humans. Two smaller COX-1-derived proteins  have also been discovered, but their precise roles are yet to be described.Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase , also known as cyclooxygenase , is the key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis. It converts free arachidonic acid, released from membrane phospholipids at the sn-2 ester binding site by the enzymatic activity of phospholipase A2, to prostaglandin  H2. The reaction involves both cyclooxygenase  and hydroperoxidase  activity. The cyclooxygenase activity incorporates two oxygen molecules into arachidonic acid or alternate polyunsaturated fatty acid substrates, such as linoleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. Metabolism of arachidonic acid forms a labile intermediate peroxide, PGG2, which is reduced to the corresponding alcohol, PGH2, by the enzyme's hydroperoxidase activity.While metabolizing arachidonic acid primarily to PGG2, COX-1 also converts this fatty acid to small amounts of a racemic mixture of 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids  composed of ~22% 15-HETE and ~78% 15-HETE stereoisomers as well as a small amount of 11-HETE. The two 15-HETE stereoisomers have intrinsic biological activities but, perhaps more importantly, can be further metabolized to a major class of anti-inflammatory agents, the lipoxins. In addition, PGG2 and PGH2 rearrange non-enzymatically to a mixture of 12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acids viz.,1 2--hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid  and 12--hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid plus Malonyldialdehyde. and can be metabolized by CYP2S1 to 12-HHT . These alternate metabolites of COX-1 may contribute to its activities.COX-1 promotes the production of the natural mucus lining that protects the inner stomach and contributes to reduced acid secretion and reduced pepsin content. COX-1 is normally present in a variety of areas of the body, including not only the stomach but any site of inflammation.COX-1 is inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  such as aspirin. Thromboxane A2, the major product of COX-1 in platelets, induces platelet aggregation. The inhibition of COX-1 is sufficient to explain why low dose aspirin is effective at reducing cardiac events.1cqe: PROSTAGLANDIN H2 SYNTHASE-1 COMPLEX WITH FLURBIPROFEN1diy: CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF ARACHIDONIC ACID BOUND IN THE CYCLOOXYGENASE ACTIVE SITE OF PGHS-11ebv: OVINE PGHS-1 COMPLEXED WITH SALICYL HYDROXAMIC ACID1eqg: THE 2.6 ANGSTROM MODEL OF OVINE COX-1 COMPLEXED WITH IBUPROFEN1eqh: THE 2.7 ANGSTROM MODEL OF OVINE COX-1 COMPLEXED WITH FLURBIPROFEN1fe2: CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF DIHOMO-GAMMA-LINOLEIC ACID BOUND IN THE CYCLOOXYGENASE CHANNEL OF PROSTAGLANDIN ENDOPEROXIDE H SYNTHASE-1.1ht5: THE 2.75 ANGSTROM RESOLUTION MODEL OF OVINE COX-1 COMPLEXED WITH METHYL ESTER FLURBIPROFEN1ht8: THE 2.7 ANGSTROM RESOLUTION MODEL OF OVINE COX-1 COMPLEXED WITH ALCLOFENAC1igx: Crystal Structure of Eicosapentanoic Acid Bound in the Cyclooxygenase Channel of Prostaglandin Endoperoxide H Synthase-1.1igz: Crystal Structure of Linoleic acid Bound in the Cyclooxygenase Channel of Prostaglandin Endoperoxide H Synthase-1.1pge: PROSTAGLANDIN H2 SYNTHASE-1 COMPLEXED WITH P-HYDROTROPIC ACID 1pgf: PROSTAGLANDIN H2 SYNTHASE-1 COMPLEXED WITH 1--5-METHOXY-2-METHYLINDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID , CIS MODEL1pgg: PROSTAGLANDIN H2 SYNTHASE-1 COMPLEXED WITH 1--5-METHOXY-2-METHYLINDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID , TRANS MODEL1prh: THE X-RAY CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF THE MEMBRANE PROTEIN PROSTAGLANDIN H2 SYNTHASE-11pth: The Structural Basis of Aspirin Activity Inferred from the Crystal Structure of Inactivated Prostaglandin H2 Synthase1q4g: 2.0 Angstrom Crystal Structure of Ovine Prostaglandin H2 Synthase-1, in complex with alpha-methyl-4-biphenylacetic acid1u67: Crystal Structure of Arachidonic Acid Bound to a Mutant of Prostagladin H Synthase-1 that Forms Predominantly 11-HPETE.2ayl: 2.0 Angstrom Crystal Structure of Manganese Protoporphyrin IX-reconstituted Ovine Prostaglandin H2 Synthase-1 Complexed With Flurbiprofen
