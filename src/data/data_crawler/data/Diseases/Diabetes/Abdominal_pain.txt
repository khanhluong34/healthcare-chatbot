Abdominal pain, also known as a stomach ache, is a symptom associated with both cancer and serious medical issues.Common causes of pain in the abdomen include gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome. About 15% of people have a more serious underlying condition such as appendicitis, leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, diverticulitis, or ectopic pregnancy. In a third of cases the exact cause is unclear.Given that a variety of diseases can cause some form of abdominal pain, a systematic approach to the examination of a person and the formulation of a differential diagnosis remains important.The most frequent reasons for abdominal pain are gastroenteritis , irritable bowel syndrome , urinary tract problems , inflammation of the stomach  and constipation . In about 30% of cases, the cause is not determined. About 10% of cases have a more serious cause including gallbladder  or pancreas problems , diverticulitis , appendicitis  and cancer . More common in those who are older, ischemic colitis, mesenteric ischemia, and abdominal aortic aneurysms are other serious causes.Acute abdomen can be defined as severe, persistent abdominal pain of sudden onset that is likely to require surgical intervention to treat its cause. The pain may frequently be associated with nausea and vomiting, abdominal distention, fever and signs of shock. One of the most common conditions associated with acute abdominal pain is acute appendicitis.A more extensive list includes the following:The location of abdominal pain can provide information about what may be causing the pain. The abdomen can be divided into four regions called quadrants. Locations and associated conditions include:EsophagusLower respiratory tractStomachProximal duodenumLiverBiliary tractGallbladderPancreasCecumAppendixAscending colonProximal transverse colonDescending colonSigmoid colonRectumFeverSuperior anal canalAbdominal pain can be referred to as visceral pain or peritoneal pain. The contents of the abdomen can be divided into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The foregut contains the pharynx, lower respiratory tract, portions of the esophagus, stomach, portions of the duodenum , liver, biliary tract , and the pancreas. The midgut contains portions of the duodenum , cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and first half of the transverse colon. The hindgut contains the distal half of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and superior anal canal.Each subsection of the gut has an associated visceral afferent nerve that transmits sensory information from the viscera to the spinal cord, traveling with the autonomic sympathetic nerves. The visceral sensory information from the gut traveling to the spinal cord, termed the visceral afferent, is non-specific and overlaps with the somatic afferent nerves, which are very specific. Therefore, visceral afferent information traveling to the spinal cord can present in the distribution of the somatic afferent nerve; this is why appendicitis initially presents with T10 periumbilical pain when it first begins and becomes T12 pain as the abdominal wall peritoneum  is involved.A thorough patient history and physical examination is used to better understand the underlying cause of abdominal pain.The process of gathering a history may include:After gathering a thorough history, one should perform a physical exam in order to identify important physical signs that might clarify the diagnosis, including a cardiovascular exam, lung exam, thorough abdominal exam, and for females, a genitourinary exam.Additional investigations that can aid diagnosis include:If diagnosis remains unclear after history, examination, and basic investigations as above, then more advanced investigations may reveal a diagnosis. Such tests include:The management of abdominal pain depends on many factors, including the etiology of the pain. Some dietary changes that some may participate in are: resting after a meal, chewing food completely and slowly, and avoiding stressful and high excitement situations after a meal. Some at home strategies like these can avoid future abdominal issues, resulting in the need of professional assistance. In the emergency department, a person presenting with abdominal pain may initially require IV fluids due to decreased intake secondary to abdominal pain and possible emesis or vomiting. Treatment for abdominal pain includes analgesia, such as non-opioid  and opioid medications . Choice of analgesia is dependent on the cause of the pain, as ketorolac can worsen some intra-abdominal processes. Patients presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain may receive a "GI cocktail" that includes an antacid  and lidocaine. After addressing pain, there may be a role for antimicrobial treatment in some cases of abdominal pain. Butylscopolamine  is used to treat cramping abdominal pain with some success. Surgical management for causes of abdominal pain includes but is not limited to cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and exploratory laparotomy.Below is a brief overview of abdominal pain emergencies.Periumbilical pain, migrates to RLQAbdominal CTIV fluids as neededGeneral surgery consultation, possible appendectomyAntibioticsPain controlImaging Labs IV fluids as neededGeneral surgery consultation, possible cholecystectomyAntibioticsPain, nausea controlLabs Imaging IV fluids as neededPain, nausea controlPossibly consultation of general surgery or interventional radiologyImaging IV fluids as neededNasogastric tube placementGeneral surgery consultationPain controlLabs Blood transfusion as neededMedications: proton pump inhibitor, octreotideStable patient: observationUnstable patient: consultation Labs Blood transfusion as neededMedications: proton pump inhibitorStable patient: observationUnstable patient: consultation Imaging Labs General surgery consultationAntibioticsCecal volvulus: Abdominal pain , nausea, vomitingImaging Cecal: General surgery consultation If ruptured ectopic pregnancy, the patient may present with peritoneal irritation and hypovolemic shockLabs: complete blood count, urine pregnancy test followed with quantitative blood beta-hCGImaging: transvaginal ultrasoundIf patient is stable: continue diagnostic workup, establish OBGYN follow-upImaging: Ultrasound, CT angiography, MRA/magnetic resonance angiographyIf patient is stable: admit for observationImaging: Chest X-Ray , CT angiography, MRA, transthoracic echocardiogram/TTE, transesophageal echocardiogram/TEEBlood transfusion as needed Medications: reduce blood pressure Surgery consultationImaging: FAST examination, CT of abdomen and pelvisDiagnostic peritoneal aspiration and lavageIf patient is unstable: general or trauma surgery consultation with subsequent exploratory laparotomyImaging: FAST examination, CT of abdomen and pelvisDiagnostic peritoneal aspiration and lavageIf patient is unstable: general or trauma surgery consultation with subsequent exploratory laparotomy and possible splenectomyIf patient is stable: medical management, consultation of interventional radiology for possible arterial embolizationAbdominal pain is the reason about 3% of adults see their family physician. Rates of emergency department  visits in the United States for abdominal pain increased 18% from 2006 through to 2011. This was the largest increase out of 20 common conditions seen in the ED. The rate of ED use for nausea and vomiting also increased 18%.
