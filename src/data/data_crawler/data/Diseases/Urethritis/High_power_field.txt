A high-power field , when used in relation to microscopy, references the field of view under the maximum magnification power of the objective being used.  Often, this represents a 400-fold magnification when referenced in scientific papers.Area per high-power field for some microscope types:The area provides a reference unit, for example in reference ranges for urine tests.Used for grading of soft tissue tumors: Grading, usually on a scale of I to III, is based
on the degree of differentiation, the average number of
mitoses per high-power field, cellularity, pleomorphism,
and an estimate of the extent of necrosis (presumably a
reflection of rate of growth). Mitotic counts and necrosis
are the most important predictors.The following grading is part of classification of breast cancer:This optics-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.
