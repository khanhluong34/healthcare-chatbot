NOD2 plays an important role in the immune system. It recognizes bacterial molecules  and stimulates an immune reaction.NOD2 is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor, which is similar in structure to resistant proteins of plants and recognizes molecules containing the specific structure called muramyl dipeptide  that is found in certain bacteria.The C-terminal portion of the protein contains a leucine-rich repeat domain that is known to play a role in protein–protein interactions. The middle part of the protein is characterized by a NOD domain involved in protein self-oligomerization. The N-terminal portion contains two CARD domains known to play a role in apoptosis and NF-κB activation pathways.This gene is a member of the NOD1/Apaf-1 family  and encodes a protein with two caspase recruitment domains  and eleven leucine-rich repeats . The protein is primarily expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes. It plays a role in the immune response by recognizing the bacterial molecules which possess the muramyl dipeptide  moiety and activating the NF-κB protein.Mutations in this gene have been associated with Crohn's disease, Blau syndrome, severe pulmonary sarcoidosis and Graft-versus-host disease.The NOD2 gene is linked to inflammatory diseases such as Inflammatory bowel disease/Crohn's disease and Blau syndrome.NOD2 has been shown to interact with NLRC4.NOD2 has also been shown to bind to MAVS in response to ssRNA or viral RNA treatment and activate the IFN response. This is the first report of NOD2 acting as a pattern-recognition receptor for viruses.
