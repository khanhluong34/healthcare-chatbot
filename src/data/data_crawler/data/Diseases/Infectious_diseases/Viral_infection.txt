A viral disease  occurs when an organism's body is invaded by pathogenic viruses, and infectious virus particles  attach to and enter susceptible cells.Basic structural characteristics, such as genome type, virion shape and replication site, generally share the same features among virus species within the same family.Human-infecting virus families offer rules that may assist physicians and medical microbiologists/virologists.As a general rule, DNA viruses replicate within the cell nucleus while RNA viruses replicate within the cytoplasm. Exceptions are known to this rule: poxviruses replicate within the cytoplasm and orthomyxoviruses and hepatitis D virus  replicate within the nucleus.This group of analysts defined multiple categories of virus.
