Self-management interventions, such as education, jaw posture relaxation, and cognitive or behavioral self regulation, have been shown to improve long-term outcomes for patients with orofacial pain, specifically in patients with TMD.

For example, in the United States, one report estimated that 22% of the general population had experienced some form of facial pain at some point in the 6-month period before questioning, of which 12% was toothache. In the United Kingdom, 7% of the general population reported having some degree of chronic orofacial pain. Other reports indicate a prevalence of 10â€“15% for TMD in the general population.A systematic review looking at the prevalence of orofacial pain found that highest prevalence was for pain on opening the mouth , muscle tenderness  and self-reported joint pain .
